  <description><![CDATA[This article exposes a series of illegal acts committed by Qin Ziyue's brother and girlfriend, who are friends studying in London. They stole someone else's phone, posted unauthorized content on social media, and wore other people's valuable items without permission. In addition, they failed to return and damaged expensive clothing, but did not offer any form of compensation. The article also calls on victims to protect their property and rights, and not to suffer from illegal acts such as the arbitrary use of items and verbal abuse due to agreement or favoritism.]]></description>
