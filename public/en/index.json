When I started this website, I hadn’t read a single pdf, I just wanted to make a website for fun to share gossip with my friends. Getting over a million views in less than a week changed everything. The past few days can be simply summarized as being pushed around by various things - friends who wanted to develop the site together, people who wanted me to promote it, those who wanted to help me figure out operations, people who wanted to contribute, invest, and those who were very enthusiastic about helping me out with ideas, to the point where I didn’t have time to truly think about what this site was really doing. The nature of this site meant that during the process of rapid growth, the “gossip” had no guarantee of authenticity, and the huge traffic inevitably brought unnecessary harm to both the exposed and the exposers. Up until now, more than 10 people have wanted their pdfs taken down due to distress caused by the site. Even if the site could really grow into a stable forum with decent traffic in the future, I really can’t accept growth driven by exploiting people’s voyeuristic desires and exposing major gossip events. The entire site was gradually deviating far from my own values as traffic increased. Therefore, after the secondary reconstruction of the site was basically completed, and the comment and like functions were added and ready to launch, I still decided to permanently close down LXSGuaTian. The community of over 2,000 people I had built will also dissolve tonight, and the advertising revenue, which was the only monetization attempt, has been fully refunded. I apologize to anyone who may have been hurt. I was working on reconstructing the site, so I launched the original fork.

For the general public, we specially select cases that reflect contemporary social realities, and train readers to explore the essence behind phenomena and develop independent thinking on social issues by providing multi-perspective analysis. For academic researchers, we gather a large number of cutting-edge cases that have not yet received widespread scholarly attention. These timely first-hand materials can enrich empirical research and broaden academic horizons. For international students, considering their dual cultural backgrounds, our cases cover East-West societal discussions, aiming to enhance international students’ cross-cultural analytical abilities and critical thinking. This will improve their academic competitiveness and employment advantages. For the Internet, we are committed to building a rational and inclusive discussion platform, providing perspectives not yet in the mainstream, to enrich online content, balance the current public opinion ecosystem, and promote the healthy development of the Internet. We uphold rational and progressive values, are not biased towards any ideology, and welcome rational discussion and exchange based on the cases from all walks of life.

I asked her to show the ticket refund record first before discussing it further, but she refused. So I just ignored it. That night, her sister contacted me, proposing that we settle the accounts, paying back any excess and making up any shortage. I refused repeatedly, but under her sister’s repeated request, I compiled the spending records, excluding all joint spending such as taxis and meals, calculating 90% of the total, which came out to 21,000 yuan paid by me. According to paying back any excess, she should have paid me money. Her side then fell silent and I stopped pursuing it. Attachment\rChat record\rOn March 13, she sent me a threatening letter, mentioning my parents and my father’s company name. I was shocked and asked her sister what was going on. Her sister said her younger sister was too young, and asked me to pay 5,500 yuan to settle it. I refused again. This was the first time and I didn’t pursue it. The second time we agreed to settle the accounts, paying back any excess and making up any shortage, but when she found out I paid more, she avoided it with silence. The third time she wanted money again, I definitely wouldn’t give any. I told her sister that I had her family information, and if they harassed my family again, I would tell her parents. Her sister agreed and also mentioned her younger sister had mental problems. I said then don’t tell her I’m going to contact the parents, to avoid aggravating her condition. I continued to ignore this matter. Attachment\rChat record\rNote\rOn March 14, she searched for my mother’s information again, trying to add her WeChat but was rejected. So I asked her sister again, and got the “the child doesn’t know any better” answer, and asked me to pay 3,300 yuan to settle it. I refused again and warned that if they harassed my family again, I would inform her parents. In the end, I didn’t pursue it further. Attachment\rChat record\rOn March 15, she somehow found my parents’ phone number (I showed her my phone but didn’t let her snoop on my family information), and sent threatening texts to them. My dad forwarded the content to our family group, and my parents were very angry, scolding me for two days. I was furious. Did she forget that she had left her own parents’ contact information when I helped her mail a package? I contacted her sister to prove I really could contact her parents and it wasn’t an empty threat. Her sister realized the severity of the situation, and created a group chat for us to communicate. After she sent the threat, she stopped contacting me, and I didn’t contact her either. But when she learned I had my parents’ contact info, she frantically called me, asking me and my parents to apologize. I said forget it, don’t make any more trouble. I thought it was over, but she sent more threats that night, saying I reported her for contract cheating and it would never be over. If I really wanted to report her, I would have done so already, why would I need to contact you? Attachment\rChat record 1\rChat record 2\rThat night, she threatened me with suicide. Her so-called friend “77” also threatened me, saying she went to the hospital for blood transfusion and gastric lavage, asking me to see the record. I agreed to see it, but the other party couldn’t produce it for half a day, and finally sent a 1,400 pound bill with no details, just the total amount. This “77” was her alt account, now deleted. The font was the same, also pretending to be her friend threatening me. I don’t understand which hospital gives bills like this. Besides, gastric lavage costs over 1,000 pounds?

This made me feel she was not a decent person. So I asked her for all my expenses, which was the 44,000 number. But she took it out of context, going to the police saying I had extorted 10,000 pounds from her, so I was inexplicably arrested, charged with blackmailing her and threatening her parents. I was completely speechless and shocked. If she could produce evidence of me demanding 10,000 pounds from her, I would directly transfer 10,000 to her, no problem. I was released the next day. I explained what happened to the police. The police said I could file another report, and they would keep my phone for investigation. Then I saw her testimony was full of lies slandering me, making me feel she was not normal. As long as she can produce a record of me demanding more than 45,000 from her, I will bite through the iron prison door. That’s why I carefully made this PDF for everyone. I was also wrong in this matter, I shouldn’t have taken her for a decent person. She told me she was a virgin, but slept with other men during our relationship. Too shameless. Many people wonder why I didn’t break up earlier if I felt something was wrong. Am I an idiot? Yes I am an idiot. I was too merciful, thinking she could still change for the better. But this was before I knew she had slandered me and slept around. Knowing this now, I feel really stupid, being so compassionate towards her. The police have returned my phone to me, saying I’m innocent, but they need to subpoena her. However, she escaped back to China, and the police couldn’t catch her when they went to her home. So I filed a case in China.

She insisted on taking me there. I said I didn’t know how to use the ticket buying app, and I was busy with some things, we could talk about it later. She kept calling me, teaching me how to buy tickets while screenshotting the process on her phone and sending it to me. She asked me to buy two tickets, but I kept failing. She didn’t believe me, asking me to record my screen to prove I couldn’t buy them. I recorded and sent it to her. After watching, she said fine, she would buy them. Then she bought one for herself (I was puzzled why she didn’t help me buy one if tickets were selling out fast), and kept rushing me to buy quickly. I tried many times but couldn’t get in. She said she would help me, asking me to send her my credit card information. After I sent it to her, she still failed the payment. Then she said slightly mockingly, “I used my card to help you buy it, tsk, don’t understand you.” Then she screenshotted the 116 pounds and sent it to me, implying I should transfer her the money, and said “don’t understand you~~” before hanging up. This is how she described it to my friend: “This cheapskate, making me buy the tickets, disgusting.” Attachment\rChat record 1\rChat record 2\rIt’s really funny. She insisted on taking me to the concert, walking me through buying tickets step-by-step. I couldn’t buy them and she grumbled about it. She only bought one ticket in two tries, saying the concert checks ID and she couldn’t buy two or I couldn’t get in with her ticket. I’ve never been to concerts, but I don’t think I’m that clueless, am I? In the end, she very reluctantly bought my ticket, still muttering about it. Does she still feel this ATM failed to dispense money? She insisted I record my screen to prove I couldn’t buy it\rChat record\rThe funniest thing is, after we broke up she told me: “I’ll just give you the ticket. If you want to see me again, it’ll be at the concert.” I had forgotten about it. She probably wanted me to return the ticket to her. But the next day, I kept receiving ticket refund confirmation codes in my email… Turns out while saying she gifted me the ticket, she was furiously applying for refunds, even impersonating me to retrieve my password and request a refund. It made me laugh hard while also feeling disgusted by her shameless lies. She also seemed to want to resell my ticket, because I received a ticket transfer confirmation code. It cracked me up. The person who bought my ticket from her even reached out to me. I found out she had given them my account and a fake password. They couldn’t log in, realized something was wrong, asked her about it, and she pushed the blame onto the buyer, saying they logged in too late. Then she blamed the buyer for being careless, basically refusing to refund the money. Later the buyer wanted to buy another ticket or get a refund. She said she would buy a 120 pound ticket for the buyer, but wanted the buyer to pay half the price, 60 pounds, trying to extort the buyer again. The buyer didn’t agree, and she said to pay at least 10-20 pounds. Even when the buyer gave 10, she still grumbled about why it wasn’t 20. She really got money in her eyes.

She told me that if she took out her ID, Cartier would see her purchase record and immediately invite her inside. I said “then take it out”. She said “too high profile, better not”. So we lined up for half an hour before finally buying. Then she went to Chaumet and walked right in. I’m not too familiar with Chaumet, just know it’s expensive. I was shocked seeing the price tags, starting at tens of thousands of pounds. So I didn’t look further and sat to the side. She asked me to look. I said I felt inferior and couldn’t stand looking at such things, where anything was millions of pounds. Later she even had the salesperson help her try on a crown said to be worth 10 million pounds! She also said she was preparing to buy one when she returned home. The salesperson said only the UK had it. She said she would ask her mother, because her dowry jewelry budget was only 10 million. She tried it on, took pictures, and posted like she had bought it all. The only thing she really bought was with my money, but she spoke as if she had bought it herself. But this is how she described it to others: She flashed her ID as soon as she entered, and the store cleared out just for her as a VIP (in reality we lined up at Cartier for half a day, and there was no one at Chaumet).

On the way, she sent me a photo of herself sitting in the passenger seat of a Bentley. I recognized it was a Continental GT, so I told her “Big Continental GT”. She started bragging to me about how rare and precious this car was, saying things like a seat’s leather was worth a Hermes bag (which had nothing to do with me, it wasn’t my car). She then said she was downstairs of my dorm building and asked me to come down to pick her up. When I went down, there was only her alone (remember, only one person, no one else). She told me “If you had come down a bit sooner you could have met my friend.” I said no problem, there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. But this is how she described this incident to others: As soon as this gold-digging man saw my friend’s car, he was jumping up and down shouting “Wow! A Bentley! Globally limited to 80 units, the second Bentley in the world!” Seeing this, my friend immediately rolled up the car window and stepped on the gas and left. And I was still on the side saying “Wow! What a nice exhaust sound!” She said I was so embarrassing and had never seen the world. When I heard about this, my thought was: This is almost unimaginable, really?

My friend had a Shanxi cultural tourism project and wanted me to take a look at whether the plan was reasonable. At the time when she saw it, she took the initiative to suggest going to Hainan to develop this project, saying the daughter of the director of the Hainan Culture and Tourism Bureau had an ironclad relationship with her. I said this was a cultural ancient town restoration cultural tourism project using information technology, with the focus on culture and ancient towns, and Hainan did not have ancient towns so it was not very suitable. But she still emphasized her connections in Hainan and told my friend to go to Hainan to develop this project. My friend said very directly that this project was aimed at the ancient towns and ancient buildings in Shanxi. First, Shanxi has recently introduced favorable policies, and second, Shanxi has a profound cultural heritage. Finally, as a tourist city, Hainan does not have ancient town ruins to do this project. She still seemed to not understand that the focus of this cultural tourism project was on cultural ancient towns. Instead, she belittled the plan and PPT my friend made, saying that such a plan would get you fired from her company, and claimed no one could compare with Hainan in the field of culture and tourism. I could only tell my friend that if there were relevant projects in Hainan, she could explain to her. She said: “Your friend’s PPT and plan would get fired directly in my company.” She said: “I don’t know who can compare with Hainan in culture and tourism.” She said: “Is your friend close with you? How could she have no eye for things?” She said: “I really feel your friend has no taste.” She said: “I really don’t understand how you can do projects without connections like mine.” But in private, this is what she said about me - This guy kept asking me to invest in projects for him. One look at his plan and you know it won’t work. He kept pestering me for investment. I asked how much he wanted directly, and he said one million. It was so annoying. I wanted to tear up that plan. He wanted one million investment for that kind of plan. I almost scolded him right there. My inner OS: You have to emphasize your investment insight and belittle my friend’s project, then say behind my back that I was the one pestering you for investment? This is just drama, I won’t even watch the Spring Festival Gala without you. You even said you wanted to invest in my parents’ company before. Who understands?

Within a week, she had called the nail technician from that salon over to her home to fix her nails four times.

Turns out she got friends in China to help log into her account and post works in China to switch the IP to China. Her original words to her friend were: “I want to study well in the UK, away from complicated social circles, so I need to change my Xiaohongshu IP to the UK!” Aside from the relationship between social circles and IP, her so-called studying well seems to be just learning how to haggle with ghostwriters. She had 12 papers ghostwritten out of 12 courses, failed 2 courses, and got an F in 1 course. She even claimed the professor graded wrong, originally giving her 77 points but accidentally entering 37, and the professor admitted the mistake but didn’t change the score, forcing her to retake the exam. To be honest, this excuse is even less believable than saying her papers were written by her pet cat. I feel this girl’s actions are incomprehensible. If she really wanted to learn and grow in the UK, she should complete her own schoolwork instead of relying on ghostwriters and fraud. At the same time, she should not fabricate lies to deceive others on social media.

I want to give some comments on a local Sydney high school student A. He appears harmless on the surface, but has done many improper things in private. My friend L is gay and he doesn’t mind people knowing it. But A went behind his back telling classmates that L liked sticking to him, which made him very uncomfortable. In fact, L is a rather introverted person. It was A who took the initiative to cling to L, while L just sat quietly next to him. What A said was slandering L. Since they went to the same high school, A spread rumors among classmates that L was a “disgusting” gay who liked everyone he saw. This led to L being briefly ostracized when he first enrolled. L has many female friends. A shamelessly went up to him and asked L to introduce girlfriends to him. Out of kindness, L did introduce some. But A not only didn’t cherish them, he also cheated everywhere, thinking about girls in other “pots” while eating out of his own. He didn’t even spare a 14-year-old girl. Fortunately, L found out in time and didn’t give the girl’s information to A. When A was in a relationship, he often looked around for other girls to flirt with. A also arrogantly believed that everyone around him was stupid. He often made up rumors to slander others. His classmate C was a victim. C had done some silly teenage things as a joke that he didn’t want to be made fun of, but A not only told everyone about it, but also made websites to humiliate C. C angrily confronted A, but A shirked responsibility. As a man who doesn’t dare to admit when he does something wrong, he really deserves to be castrated. Later when they saw C was not to be trifled with, they spread rumors off campus, which led to many people who didn’t know C gossiping about him for a while. As time went by, A’s reputation at school was also seen through by more and more students. One’s public image cannot withstand the test of time, and few people wanted to hang out with him anymore. Girls should stay away from him when they encounter him. He is not a good person, stay away from this high school Teddy boy. These were some very childish matters that needn’t be written out, but he had harassed too many people. I hope that female students at school can keep their distance when they encounter him. He is no good, stay away from this high school Teddy boy. Feel free to supplement more details.

After confirming several times that it was only him, it turned out that his brother also came, and they each took a set of Dior suits. His brother also borrowed a Dior brooch. After taking graduation photos, they didn’t return the clothes promptly. When I went to get my clothes back, I found one of the white suits casually thrown in the closet with a hanger nearby, but it wasn’t hung up. This showed that they didn’t cherish clothes that didn’t belong to them. I found that there were foundation marks all over the collar and asked his brother to take it to the dry cleaners. He agreed, but after two days, the clothes were still not cleaned. He wore my white suit again without my knowledge and posted photos on various social media platforms. I had specifically loaned the white suit to Qin Ziyue and did not agree for his brother to wear it. For several days, I was worried and almost had my brooch damaged, but SA helped me repair it. In the end, I had to spend my own money to have the clothes dry cleaned, but there were two obvious stains on the clothes that couldn’t be removed.

She often posts other people’s photos in her moments. Is it because she is not good-looking and steals other people’s photos? In addition, she openly declares that she wants to mess with others, spreading rumors about female students, which is really hard to say. Since she entered Kaplan Preparatory School and then the Education Department in Birmingham, she has insulted many victims, and even publicly exposed various personal privacy such as photos, home addresses, and phone numbers. Let me tell you how I got involved with this lady: my friend asked me about her because she was very famous in the group before (I will attach specific chat records later). I advised my friend to be careful and not get too close to her. Somehow, my WeChat account and TikTok account were leaked to her, and she harassed me for a whole semester. After scolding me, she often changed her profile picture and WeChat account, and shared my photos and videos as invitations to go out for hot pot. She even took screenshots of my TikTok videos that I didn’t allow downloading and shared them. What makes me even more disgusted is that she posted a group photo of me and my family on her moments, and then publicly exposed us on the Internet. In addition, she also publicly exposed the home addresses of me and my classmates on Xiaohongshu, which really made me very disgusted. After a while, she stopped, and I thought I could avoid her and enjoy Christmas, but she started spreading rumors that I and my classmates were engaged in prostitution again. After seeing the screenshots my friend sent me, I was really angry. I never thought there would be such shameless people!

Both the Scape-limited boyfriend and I knew each other, and we both thought we were just friends of the scumbag girl. After a confrontation among the three of us, the scumbag girl denied anything that had happened between us, and even though I wanted to tell the truth and reconcile with her, she had already apologized and swore.

I didn’t mind paying the bill, even if he didn’t say anything, I would still occasionally pay for it. Although it was common for guys to pay for meals when dating, I would also occasionally pay for meals and even give gifts. But I really didn’t like the way he asked me to pay as a “rich lady”, it felt weird. I forgot one thing, which was that before we started dating, we went to Costco together. We bought over 600 pounds worth of things, and he said let the “rich lady” pay, 6, and I ended up paying the bill. To me, this behavior was strange. He told his friends that his bank card was demagnetized and could only be used to pay bills below 100 at a time, and then I said I would pay. So he accepted my payment without any guilt. When he invited his friends to dinner, I paid for it with my card. Although at the time I thought, if you really don’t want to treat your girlfriend and let her pay the bill, you can split it into two or three payments of 100. My concern was not about a few hundred pounds, but about this behavior. During the time we were together, he told me that he had a bank card with a flow of 190k pounds in his senior year, so the card was frozen. (Is spending 190k pounds a year a lot? Why can’t he apply for a new one?) He also always told me that he was planning to buy a McLaren, Ferrari, Aston Martin and other cars, and even asked me to help him see which one looked good.

We had been together for two months, and he only gave me a Polaroid camera and only gave me a gift on our two-month anniversary. Before we started dating, he only gave me an LV scarf, a small coin purse as a Christmas and New Year’s gift, and a bottle of perfume. After we started dating, he only gave me eternal flowers, and I never received any gifts for other holidays or anniversaries. On the contrary, I gave him different gifts for every holiday and anniversary, but he always made empty promises. Finally, he said it was because we had a big age difference, and the gifts should have been separated from me? On the other hand, I gave him Givenchy cardholders, Dior ties, Fendi hats, Fendi clothes, Dior perfume, Alyx necklaces, and even small gifts such as bathrobes, toothbrushes, tooth cups, showerheads, and photo collages. Because he had less hair, I bought him hair growth gummies and calcium tablets. He had two cats at home, but only one drinking bowl, so when I was wandering alone, I bought a drinking bowl for his cats to prevent them from fighting. In fact, I deliberately controlled the gifts I gave him because I didn’t want to put too much pressure on him, and I had never received too expensive gifts. Otherwise, I might give him more expensive gifts. Gifts given by the author\rDuring our dating period, I never thought of asking him for anything. Every time he offered, but nothing ever came of it. Also, when we went shopping, I never let him pay for me, even for cosmetics and shower gel, I always paid for them myself. On the contrary, sometimes I even paid for some of his things. I won’t go into details here, but just give a general idea. In this situation, when we went on a trip, he suddenly asked me, “How many things in your house did I give you?” I was shocked and very surprised. Wasn’t it always me who gave gifts? So I answered three gifts, a scarf, a coin purse, and an aromatherapy.

That afternoon, I was a bit distant towards him for a short two hours because my good friends found out that the two-month anniversary gift he gave me was just a casual Polaroid and he didn’t comfort me or make it up to me. At that time, he told me that their original two-month gift was supposed to be a CCD camera for me, but they couldn’t find a better alternative with better color. I believed him at the time, but later found out that it was just an excuse, and the gift was just an empty one. Although I was happy to receive the gift he gave me, the Polaroid, because I am a simple person and thought that receiving a small gift from a boyfriend was a happy thing, I posted an Instagram story saying that I was happy to receive a travel gift from my boyfriend (which was brought back during the trip, and it happened to be our two-month anniversary that day). In the afternoon, I chatted with him normally, and then went to the gym and a friend’s birthday party at night. At the party, Vincent kept asking me why I was so cold to him in the afternoon, and I kept saying it was nothing. I didn’t want to make him sad and wanted to communicate this issue with him in a few days if I still felt uncomfortable. Later, he kept asking, so I said, “I feel like you don’t care about our anniversary and holidays.” Then he asked: “Do you think we have to go to a fancy restaurant for our anniversary?” “Do you think the Polaroid isn’t good enough?” At first, when I received the Polaroid camera, I was happy and didn’t consider its value or what it represented to eat in a certain restaurant. I don’t know why he used such sarcastic words. On the day we were together and within a month, we went to Michelin-starred restaurants. I think it’s normal, and I also go to Michelin-starred restaurants or special occasion restaurants with my friends from time to time. These are all normal things. But I didn’t say we had to go to a Michelin-starred restaurant. I just happened to want barbecue that day, so I suggested going to a barbecue place. I didn’t think that we had to eat at a certain restaurant on our anniversary, but I was disappointed with his questioning attitude. He questioned me with this attitude, and I left. I apologized to his friends and left because it was unbearable. I felt very wronged because I didn’t do anything wrong, but he blamed me for it. I have never been treated like this before, and it really made me feel very wronged.

Sometimes, after arguing with him, I would feel pain in my chest. I saw the doctor many times (more than five times), but he never accompanied me once, and I always went alone. He always had various excuses for not going with me, such as not getting enough sleep or applying for a visa, etc. Because of this, we had many fights. Except for the visa incident, I think it was an objective factor, and he did nothing wrong. But what was even more outrageous was that during my illness, my eyes were allergic, causing my whole face to be allergic and very painful, but he still came to my house and argued with me, and even slammed the door and left. The following are screenshots of evidence. I want to ask you, is it sick for a sick person to smile happily? Conversation between the author and Zhang Qihang\rAuthor: I don’t understand why I’m in so much pain and you still argue with me. Zhang Qihang: I don’t understand. I just got up and saw that you were uncomfortable, so I quickly washed up and dressed and came over. But when I walked in, I saw you giving me a bad look, and then you say this and that. What am I doing wrong? Author: Then you can go back, I’m sorry. Zhang Qihang: Do you think what you’re saying is good? Author: What do you mean? Author: I just think it’s unnecessary. There’s no need for anything. Zhang Qihang: I just think it’s unnecessary. There’s no need for anything. Did you think carefully before saying that? Author: I’ve thought about more than just that sentence. Author: Did I ask for the moon? I just wanted you to accompany me to see the doctor and buy medicine. I didn’t expect that when I was so sick, you would still argue with me and not let me have my way. I don’t know who is giving whom a bad look. If we can’t talk it out, then let’s break up. If we had just broken up earlier, we wouldn’t have so many troubles now. When all of my good friends were helping me deliver medicine, he was arguing with me.

Then I accidentally broke the floor mirror in my house, so there were broken pieces all over the floor, but in reality, I just had a few cuts on the soles of my feet when I was walking, and there was some bleeding. It was definitely an accident, and I never intended to harm myself. That night, my two friends came to my house promptly to take care of me, and it was nothing like the rumors outside saying that I wanted to commit suicide. Those were all pure nonsense. People who know me know that I take good care of myself, so for a while after that, my house didn’t dare to have alcohol, and now I understand that I shouldn’t touch alcohol if I am not happy.

We agreed that he would come to my birthday party. If I still had some idealized thoughts about him before my birthday, then after my birthday party, I completely saw through his true face. First of all, on March 15th, I told him the time and place, and on March 28th, I told him the dress code. I was very serious about preparing for my 20th birthday, which I moved up to April 3rd and did a lot of preparation for, including booking a private room, photographer, and venue, etc. My biggest mistake was inviting him to my birthday party. A few days before my birthday, I didn’t want to invite him anymore, but because I had already created a group and the restaurant had made name cards and arrangements, I thought it was too late to change anything. But I overestimated some people’s shamelessness, and he actually came to my birthday party. Here are screenshots of the relevant evidence: Chat record\rAfter I expressed my discomfort with his behavior of not following the dress code: Chat record 1\rChat record 2\rIt’s best to ask your heart, but we really shouldn’t talk about this. To add on, it was his birthday and we were on a trip. After he fell asleep, I went to the hotel front desk at 3:00 am and arranged for them to prepare a small cake and champagne to be sent to his room (as shown in the picture below). The next morning, I went to the front desk to confirm the delivery time and added the tip to the bill. At the time, I thought I had done well and wanted to surprise him. However, when he saw it, he not only didn’t say thank you but also asked me why it wasn’t a better brand of champagne like Dom Perignon. How was I supposed to know that they had Dom Perignon in Montenegro? What does this mean? Should I not have done anything at all? (I wanted to ask him, you always say that your efforts are not appreciated and you don’t know what to do, but have you ever appreciated my intentions?) On my birthday, you were the first person to say that you couldn’t eat the birthday cake, leaving me speechless. Cake\rI feel like I’m the only one who thinks that you dressed way too outrageously on my birthday. I told you a week in advance about our dress code requirements, which were to wear a suit, and the location and time. But you insisted on wearing a black skirt, a lace shirt, and a sensory hat. Do you think you have good taste? Afterwards, you even said that you washed your pants but didn’t wash them well. You can’t even plan your time as an adult, can’t even buy an extra pair of pants, but you can buy a McLaren? You didn’t even show basic respect, and if you didn’t want to come, you could have just declined the invitation. Instead, you made me sick on my happy birthday. At my birthday party, you even pulled my other two friends to chat, so they didn’t have time to take pictures with me. You talked about how much money you spent on your game account and even asked to borrow money to pay for the bill. You don’t even pay back the money you owe, but you still want to pretend. We’re not boyfriend and girlfriend, and yet you still manage to make me feel guilty. You even asked me what “V” meant and talked to me about whether I felt guilty or not. Don’t you think this is inappropriate? Although your behavior is very disgusting, I still let you in, which is a kind of mercy. A few days before my birthday, I started feeling like I didn’t want to invite you anymore. After all, your behavior was too much.

I don’t know why I tolerated so much, and I became more and more unlike myself. I want to say that emotional trampling can also hurt people, not just things like cheating and domestic violence that can be publicly discussed (those are too foolish, I can only say). This relationship made a confident, sunny, and positive girl often doubt whether she was not good enough, whether she was not worthy of love… I just want to slap myself at the time. If I had to go through this relationship again, I would still make the same mistakes. But for this relationship, I really don’t want to experience it again. I will never choose to agree to be with him again. Now, it’s hard not to attribute my low interest in the opposite sex to him. Before we got together, my mother told me not to date someone who needs financial support. I thought it was funny and even posted it on WeChat Moments. Sometimes he would joke with me about it too. Before we got together, he said he didn’t like London girls, they were all gold diggers. Now I really want to ask him, is there a reason why you got together with me because you don’t have to spend money on me?… My friends always say that I look stupid and easy to deceive. Is sincerity so laughable in this era? I was even so stupid that I broke up on March 2nd and didn’t give him the gift for two months.

He was not worth it, but at least he respected my opinion, and I cannot refute that. We started dating because I appreciated his attitude towards things and thought he had a good personality, and I thought he really liked me (even though he didn’t meet my previous boyfriend’s physical standards, including height and appearance). But the fact is, I couldn’t see him clearly. Love has never been a necessity in my life, and my friends are my family. In the short two months before this, I had not been in a relationship for a year, and then I encountered such a thing. Of course, Vincent is not the only problem. According to his description, I was already his best girlfriend. I appreciate the meals he cooked for me during our relationship, and he didn’t let me wash dishes. Although I didn’t do dishes in my previous relationships either. He also bought me medicine once or twice, although I didn’t say it, my good friends would spontaneously buy medicine and other things for me. But at least he didn’t do nothing, that’s what I can think of now. In fact, I hesitated before publishing these. I’m afraid that if I publish it, my next partner will not know that my previous partner had embarrassed me like this, and they will treat me the same or worse. I used to think that if you like someone, you shouldn’t write a PDF that makes the situation too embarrassing. During the time just after we broke up, I tried to maintain his image, and most of what I said was about his good side. It was only later that what happened made me and my friends feel very speechless. It’s not difficult to admit that I misjudged a person. I once asked myself if there was a reason to make this matter public? In fact, I struggled for a long time. Gossip may further damage my image, and what impact would it have on Vincent? After nearly a month of thinking, I think: a person must bear certain consequences for the harm caused. If you haven’t done decent things, why should you get decent treatment? Moreover, rumors have never stopped. It’s better for me to come out and clarify some things than to have someone spread rumors. That’s all! The truth is as above.

I used to have an assistant arrange my itinerary when I went to Thailand, but that time I went with two travel idiots who didn’t know how to plan. Because he had spent a long holiday in Thailand before, I asked him for advice. After that, we started chatting every day. As an Aries, I have a straightforward personality and speak my mind, so I got along well with him. When we were together, he didn’t spend any money on me or give me any gifts, but he should have covered the regular expenses such as hotel, food, and transportation. I am indeed a love brain, and the time from meeting my exes to being together did not exceed one month, but not all Aries women will tie themselves to one tree. For those who act cute and try to be keyboard warriors, please save your energy and stop bothering me.

During an online Q\u0026A session for a master’s program, a Chinese female international student suddenly turned on her camera, showing her and a male student engaging in sexual activity. The whole process lasted only about 15 seconds and was interrupted by the host’s exclamation of “oh my gosh.” The video and screenshots were quickly circulated in a WeChat group and on Little Red Book. At first, this incident did not attract much attention, but a few days later, a post by Carrie appeared on the adult wall at UCSD. The post roughly said, “I am the person who was cuckolded. I gave my girlfriend to you (referring to the male student in the video), but you two betrayed me together. I am no longer a boyfriend, so let’s destroy together!” The cuckold admitted that he was the one who turned on the female student’s camera and even dared to engage in illegal activities. This incident quickly attracted attention, and Jon in a campus gossip group began to expose the conflict between Carrie and a female student (who had already graduated) in the Rady graduate group. The content was roughly that the female student had a relationship with the male student in the video and had been his girlfriend. Later, the cuckold also exposed that they had a “swapping” relationship and sent a large number of the female student’s life photos/ooxx videos with the female student and the female student in the zoom video. A year ago, UCSD had an incident where two people were caught having sex in the Geisel Library, and the female lead turned out to be the female student in the video. Later, the female lead in the zoom video also participated in the conflict and began to expose the cuckold’s bad behavior, and the cuckold began to expose the female student’s photos. Finally, the cuckold revealed that all the previous disputes between the three of them were fabricated by him after stealing their three phones.

He has cheated many women and has a very wide scope of activities. Xing Lecong WeChat\rXing Lecong WeChat\rNow let me talk about my personal experience. This individual actively asked for my WeChat through my Little Red Book account. Little Red Book conversation\rLittle Red Book conversation\rAt the beginning, we occasionally chatted. Initially, it was relatively normal, but then he began to speak nonsensically at times. WeChat conversation 1\rWeChat conversation 2\rFor some time, we didn’t contact each other. One day, he suddenly informed me that he had moved to London and wanted to watch a movie with me. I agreed, and he came to pick me up by car. This was our first meeting, but he tried to touch me inappropriately throughout the movie, trying to hold my hand and cuddle with me, but I rejected him. After the movie, I wanted to go home. He had planned for us to find a place to eat and have a drink (because I hadn’t eaten), but his behavior made me feel uncomfortable, so I said I wanted to go home. However, something unexpected happened that night. A friend of mine wrote a program to snatch up face-to-face appointments for Spanish visas, and he messaged me while I was watching the movie, saying that we had got an appointment for the next morning at 10 am. I looked worried, and he asked me what was going on. I explained the situation, saying that the agency that was supposed to provide my materials wasn’t open yet and that the itinerary I prepared myself, including the travel confirmation, was not completed. Additionally, I didn’t have a printer at home. He then suggested that he would help me prepare and asked me to accompany him for a few drinks and a meal. I agreed and thanked him for his help, but warned him not to do anything inappropriate to me. Then we went back to his house where he let me use his computer to process my visa application. At first, I was not satisfied with his behavior at the cinema, but he kept instilling in me the message that he likes me: “You look really beautiful,” “You are my goddess, aren’t you?” “Not everyone has the chance to come to my house,” “Be my girlfriend. Look into my eyes, I am serious,” “Who says you can’t sleep with someone on the first date and still be together? My ex-girlfriend and I slept together on the first date, and we were together for four years.” His words downplayed my dissatisfaction with his behavior at the cinema. It was late that day, and he kept kissing me on my ear, neck, and other sensitive areas while helping me with my visa application, making me feel that he was really experienced. Eventually, I agreed to have sexual relations with him under his constant teasing. Although I thought it was just a short-lived sexual relationship, he quickly started looking for the next person to deceive. Later, I met him at MOS, and he wanted me to introduce my beautiful friends to his friends and make them to match. I was very disgusted with his behavior and told him directly that I would have to see if my friends are willing to go. It is worth reminding my girlfriends that the way to make friends is very important. Even if his friends are normal, if you meet them through this type of person’s introduction, it does not mean that they will have more respect for you.

If this was the first time I encountered such a thing, I might have chosen to endure it as well. However, my first time was in 2020 when I was cheated by a scumbag, and I didn’t take any action at that time. I regret it very much. So this time, I won’t let myself be wronged and just let it go. If someone else doesn’t want to expose you, then I’ll stand up and take the hit. In addition, I hope that girls in London will value themselves and not work hard to please these scumbags for inflated prices, paying out of pocket, or jealousy. This approach is not worth it at all. We should not encourage this kind of behavior. There are too many fools in London now. Two years ago, perhaps six out of ten people were foolish, but now nine out of ten people are foolish. When choosing friends, character is still the most important thing, after all, no one can completely avoid the influence of the surrounding environment.

She often cried in the apartment. Her roommates comforted her more than once, but when Lulu cried in the middle of the night, Xie Jun did not comfort her, but instead pressed his hand over her mouth, telling her not to make noise and disturb the roommates. Lulu was very disappointed and cried in the bathroom for more than half an hour. What made Lulu even more devastated was that when she found out that her father was in the ICU and confided in Xie Jun, she did not get any comfort from him. Instead, Xie Jun caused a scene because Lulu did not accompany him to the hospital when he got drunk at a dinner party. At a friend’s birthday party, Lulu’s joke made Xie Jun demand that she move out of his apartment at midnight. Lulu was very angry and left with her luggage in the middle of the night. The next day, she called more than ten friends to help her move. During this period, Xie Jun kept apologizing and begging for reconciliation, and brought Lulu four pills of cow bezoar and a tube of watermelon frost to comfort her. In front of their friends, Xie Jun said that he and Lulu broke up because Lulu’s family was in financial difficulty and he was afraid that he could not help her pay the first semester’s tuition, so he had to break up with her. Later on, Xie Jun bought a discounted ring and a bracelet of his own size (which he claimed was a half-year anniversary gift) in front of his friends and gave them to Lulu, along with a Dyson hair dryer and a Lancome black bottle, pretending to cherish his girlfriend. In fact, when Lulu moved out, she took a lot of her belongings, leaving Xie Jun without basic necessities such as a rice cooker, hair dryer, and skincare products, making it difficult for him to live a normal life, so he had to buy these things. Then, in the middle of the night, he cried and begged Lulu for several hours, but Lulu eventually refused him. The next day, they went to an amusement park. In fact, after breaking up, Xie Jun first stirred up their friend circle and then flirted with more than one girl, inviting two classmates to the amusement park. However, he did not expect that Lulu agreed to get back together, so the amusement park plan with his classmates was put on hold. In fact, he had been flirting with one of his classmates, and even had lunch with her after getting back together with Lulu. And when Lulu specially went to the classroom to wait for him after school, he did not show up on time.

This is not an exaggeration. I just want to present solid evidence). But these are not living expenses. He insisted that he paid for meals, and I said I also paid for meals. Okay, I don’t care, I won’t pursue it. He also said that I didn’t pay for utilities, and I was speechless. First of all, you run a Texas private club, do you deduct utilities from it? Secondly, I only lived there for a few months. If you insist on calculating like this, I had a car, and I picked you up and dropped you off for ten months. Will you share the parking fees, fines, and fuel costs? These are all ridiculous! I paid for my own insurance. A man who says such things really embarrasses himself. I don’t want to dwell on this, but I said “OK” and he also said “OK” halfway. However, he did return half of the money to me (April 28, 2023), but I am angry that he slandered me. What makes me speechless is that he is called a scammer by the outside world because of financial problems, but in fact, he tells others outside that he has never borrowed money from me, and I cannot provide evidence! He even said that he does not owe me money and that the money is all made up by myself. This is the evidence of his actual arrears to me.

First of all, I think it’s perfectly fine for couples and friends to make fun of each other. But I hope they say things that are truthful and not make up rumors. Secondly, I did regret a little when we broke up, so when I was joking with my friend, I only said that he was a big spender, but didn’t specify which aspect. We didn’t even reveal the specific content of our chat! But Kan Bowen repeated both of our gift lists and said that he spent a lot of cash buying these gifts for me, so everyone thought he wasn’t after my money, and that I was making up stories. I only regret doing the bill (I did it recently), and we’ve been broken up for five months! Including him and his current girlfriend going on a trip that requires a lot of money, I can totally understand that. However, I didn’t force him to pay me back or not go on the trip. I don’t want things to be so awkward. If he really doesn’t have the money, I won’t force him. But if he has the money and deliberately doesn’t pay me back, I will be angry. I don’t just want his money, but I care more about his attitude. Slandering and Bragging About Me I recently found out that Kan Bowen was slandering me, saying that we broke up and I demanded 4,000 pounds as a breakup fee, and that I blocked him at his doorstep and took the money away. When I confronted him, he said he only told his current girlfriend about it (he admitted to saying it first), but I wonder, why do I know about it then? His explanation was that he never said it, it was a game of telephone and the rumors got out of hand. I somewhat believe this explanation, but the fact remains that you did talk about these false things. Conversation between the author and Kan Bowen\rConversation between the author and Kan Bowen\rIf I hadn’t found out and you had given the money you owed me to someone else and called it a breakup fee, that would have been really cool. Creating a breakup fee fund for your ex-girlfriend’s money, thinking that this is the generosity that a wealthy person should have, you really overestimate yourself. At the same time, he also told others that he spent all the money he earned on me because he didn’t have much time for gambling and private casino games when he was with me. Brother, please don’t be so presumptuous. You clearly invested the money elsewhere. I don’t want to take responsibility for this matter, thank you. But what I needed at the time was his company, not his so-called money. Brother, I really don’t need it.

Around midnight, I met Kan Bowen at the casino. At that time, someone at the scene told me that Kan Bowen had been playing Texas Hold’em at the casino since 5 pm. I didn’t believe he didn’t have any money, so I sent him a private message asking, “Is it true that you don’t have any money, or do you not want to return my money?” If he didn’t want to return it, then I would expose him. He was very angry and began to insult me, calling me crazy and saying that talking to me was a mistake. I had already told him that it was a mistake, but he still said that. He also threatened me very aggressively, saying, “If you expose my story, forget it.” I didn’t care about the money anymore, but his words made me feel devastated. By then, he had left the casino. Because of my poor state, my friend saw the situation and got angry after reading our conversation. So my friend called Kan Bowen’s friend over and showed him the conversation between Kan Bowen and me about his current girlfriend. Later, Kan Bowen’s current girlfriend added me on WeChat, and we talked about the specific situation. I found out how he talked about me behind my back (the breakup fee reached 4,000 pounds), and I cursed him directly. Finally, he apologized. Conversation between the author and Kan Bowen\rAfter Kan Bowen’s friend found out, he immediately asked Kan Bowen to repay half of the loan he had promised me, and I thought the matter was over. The point is, although he has apologized and I don’t want to curse him anymore, he suddenly messaged me after waking up, saying that I lost his girlfriend. He also said that the reason why he had previously slandered his girlfriend with me was because he was afraid that I would be unhappy and would retaliate against him. I called him out on his bullshit, saying that he was the one who spoke ill of his girlfriend, not me forcing him to say those things. It was agreed that they broke up six months ago, why does he think I would want to retaliate against him? Even if I did, I would have done it a long time ago. I know about his current girlfriend, his previous girlfriend, and his past mistakes with his friends.

During the Spring Festival, we were not together, and she often went to a friend’s house to play and would send me videos of cats and other content. However, she always came back late at night. Later, when I went to Jinan to see her in February, I saw her phone album and found out that her ex-boyfriend had been playing with her during that time, and what happened is unknown. Later, I forgave her. We lived together again in Shanghai from March until we separated in July. Then in August, she secretly met with her ex-boyfriend. When they had dinner with friends, she even video-called her ex-boyfriend and asked him to come back later. I found out about this from her chat records with her friends later. Here’s the key part: at the end of August 2022, because we were studying in different countries, I went to the United States and she went to the United Kingdom. On the first day she arrived in the UK, she blocked me because of a fight, and added me back the next day. In addition, she had been drinking with other people in the apartment and deleted all content related to me on social media. She even used Xiaohongshu to flirt with other guys. According to statistics, in September alone, 20 guys had already added her to their WeChat Moments, which laid the foundation for our breakup later. In early October, because my UK visa was not approved, wzy started a fight with me and said she wanted to break up. I had to expedite the process. By the end of October, I finally arrived in Glasgow, but when we went out to play cards or eat, we always did it together. However, she told others behind my back that I was her ex-boyfriend, not her current boyfriend. This shocked me, and I had no idea about it. From October 21st to November 7th, during my time in Glasgow, our relationship can be said to have not diminished at all. When I flew back to the United States last time, she even told me that she missed me and wanted to see me again soon. However, just less than a week after I left, on November 11th, she attended a friend’s birthday party with a guy named A who she had previously added on Xiaohongshu, and they even slept together that night. I only found out about this much later, from A and her own admission. But before admitting it, she even swore on her mother’s life to prove her innocence. I believed her and flew back to Glasgow from New York on November 13th. However, when I arrived, she told me that she didn’t like me as much anymore and wanted to break up. I naively thought that it was my fault that we didn’t work out. Although I respected her decision, I still wanted to see if there was a chance, so I left Glasgow for a friend’s house in London that day.

Later, he began to meet me frequently, and we almost met every day, and we spent almost every day together in a month, which made me think he had changed.

Although we had arguments sometimes, we also had happy times. At first, he treated me and my family well, like a family. My mom really liked him and always praised him for being sensible. I fell into his sweet words and caring inquiries from the beginning. He was good at treating girls, and he was used to it. He often ordered takeout for me, took me out to play, gave me flowers, and always came to see me. Now I realize that his intention was too obvious. No one will be nice to you for no reason. Also, don’t be confused by sudden material things. He will suddenly be nice to you and to others. When I got my marriage certificate, we agreed to keep it a secret. He went home very happily that day, but his mom actually saw it in the drawer while cleaning. He said he did something very important that day, and his mom asked if he would regret it. He said confidently that he would not. He also promised me that he had prepared everything and would propose to my mom. I said okay, I would wait for him. In the months before going abroad in April 2022, I was always locked up in his house because of the pandemic, and we were together day and night. His parents were very nice to me too. I always observed what he liked to eat and what he wanted to buy. Before, when we went on a date, I had a notebook to record my feelings, what happened when we went out, whether it was happy or not, what he liked to eat and what he liked. After I finished writing, I stopped recording. I secretly bought him something he really wanted before going abroad. He even posted a WeChat Moment about it, and I was really happy at that time. He used to post WeChat Moments actively and asked me why I didn’t post. Everything changed after going abroad. The first time the flight he booked for me was cancelled, and I was originally planning to take a taxi home that day. He suggested that we go home together since the flight was cancelled. I burst into tears in the car and immediately turned back to go home with him, thinking that we could be together for a few more days. The second time, I helped him pack his luggage and sent him to the airport. I really missed him. Before he left, he changed his phone wallpaper to my photo and said, “I want you to be happy for a few more days.” I didn’t realize that my nightmare was about to begin, I only felt sad about his departure. He has changed completely after going abroad, becoming extremely selfish and only wanting to make himself happy.

From childhood to adulthood, everything he said was a lie, like his mother driving a Porsche 911 and his father driving an AMG (but in reality, his mother doesn’t even know how to drive, and his father is a ride-hailing driver). He likes to show off his wealth in front of classmates, cares a lot about his reputation, and has a strong sense of vanity, wanting to portray himself as a “rich second generation.” I never cared whether he really had these material things or not, I just wanted to live a simple and happy life with him. I hoped he could tell me the truth. When I first met him, his name and age were both fake. My mom and I called him by his fake name for months. Because I was obedient and believed everything he said. He thought I was obedient and didn’t want to deceive me, so he told me the truth but asked me not to tell my mom. I promised him, but I secretly told my mom, and one day she accidentally called him by his real name. He was angry with me for breaking my promise and told my mom. I spent two birthdays with him, and everyone could see how much effort I put into it and how much love was in my eyes, but he only became more and more distant towards me.

Some characteristics to judge whether a person has NPD\rEach of the following points requires self-reflection and introspection. If you want to identify someone with a “toxic personality,” you cannot focus solely on their behavior. You will also learn to pay attention to the warning signals that arise in your own mind. They will magnify your flaws infinitely and make you look abnormal. They do not consider anyone else’s perspective. They are all complete hypocrites. They will lie and make excuses uncontrollably, only focusing on your mistakes while ignoring their own. You will find yourself having to explain the most basic form of respect between people to a healthy adult. They are usually extremely selfish and have a desire to watch others suffer. They will evoke extreme emotions from you and then turn around and blame you for it. You will gradually find yourself investigating a relationship like a detective. You will be the only one who sees their true face. You will start to worry that any argument you have could be the last one. They will slowly and maliciously invade your boundaries and limits. They will never give you enough attention and slowly chip away at your self-esteem. They do not communicate proactively and instead expect you to read their minds accurately. Around this person, you will always feel nervous and uneasy, but you still hope they will like you. You will find that they have encountered many so-called “psychos” in the past. They will pretend not to care while intentionally hurting your jealous feelings. They will put you on a pedestal, shower you with love, and idealize you to the extreme at the beginning. They will compare you to everyone else in their life. The qualities they once said they liked about you will eventually turn into intolerable flaws. You will observe occasional cracks in their perfect mask. They easily get bored and have a short attention span. There are triangular relationships or multiple relationships. In intimate relationships, they will exhibit hidden abusive behavior, while showing a completely different set of behaviors in front of others. They will trade tragic stories for sympathy and use it for their own benefit. They will increase the cycle of praise and criticism, constantly suppressing you. This person will become your entire life, and you will gradually lose your friends and hobbies. They are extremely arrogant and have a sense of entitlement. They like to talk about others behind their backs, and the specific content changes constantly. The most important signal is your inner feeling.

I previously rented a house with my roommate in Sydney for a year, and we paid the deposit. Due to the epidemic, I couldn’t go back to Australia during the holidays, so my roommate helped me sublet my room through an agency. This girl signed the contract with her name on it. I don’t remember when she started renting, but she moved out early within the contract period and didn’t pay the remaining rent for the contract period, which amounted to more than 1,000 Australian dollars. The amount was deducted from my deposit.\rConversation between netizen’s roommate and Wang Zhengtai\rNetizen’s roommate: You still need to pay two weeks of rent. That person moved in on the 1.8th. Netizen’s roommate: Originally, it was due on the 15th, but she moved in on the 8th because you weren’t there. Netizen’s roommate: You can also pay one week less. Wang Zhengtai: But she can pay whenever she moves in. Wang Zhengtai: You can sign a new contract after she pays until the 15th. Netizen’s roommate: Yeah, she moved in on the 8th. Netizen’s roommate: She has her own place now. Netizen’s roommate: She said she would move in on the 15th. Netizen’s roommate: Because your lease ends on the 15th. Wang Zhengtai: She can pay from the 8th to the 15th, and then you can sign a new contract with her. Netizen’s roommate: Yes, but you need to pay before that. Wang Zhengtai: You can collect her rent from the 8th to the 15th, which won’t affect anything. Roommate of the netizen: I mean, you still have to pay the rent before the 8th. Roommate of the netizen: After the 8th, I won’t ask you for it anymore. Wang Zhengtai: What about your previous roommate? Isn’t she coming back to live with you? I see her luggage is still at home. Roommate of the netizen: She wants to come back, but she’s not sure. Before you moved in, she thought she could come back and kept paying rent until she couldn’t find a roommate. Roommate of the netizen: Because her contract still has half a year left. Roommate of the netizen: If you move out before your contract ends, you still have to pay the rent. Otherwise, you can find someone to live with you for a few weeks, but the contract is under your name. Roommate of the netizen: You definitely have to pay before the contract ends. Conversation between netizens and the author 2\rNetizen: It should have been originally one month from 12.15 to 1.15, but later my roommate found her other friend to move in on January 8th. However, she did not pay the rent during the period from December 15th to January 8th, and deducted it from my deposit. Netizen: Wang Zhengtai: I have moved out and no longer live there, and I didn’t pay for it. I know the contract hasn’t expired, but I don’t want to pay for a house that I don’t live in when I’m abroad. I only paid for the days I lived there. Netizen: These are her exact words and her logic. Netizen: The screenshots above are all conversations between my roommate and her. Conversation between netizens and Wang Zhengtai\rWang Zhengtai: Type it out. Netizen: We signed the contract together. Netizen: I paid the deposit, but I didn’t go back later. Netizen: Now the landlord says there is rent missing. Wang Zhengtai: I have nothing to do with this contract anymore. Netizen: You need to make up for it. Wang Zhengtai: I can’t. Netizen: Then you need to make up for the missing rent, sis. Netizen: ? Netizen: ? Conversation with Netizens 3\rNetizen: Hey, are you there? That Wang Zhengtai guy rented a house from me and my roommate before, but he didn’t pay the rent for the last month and left the room dirty and smelly. I can show you the screenshots. Netizen: She left and the carpet was all dirty. I had to find someone to clean it. Netizen: She even claimed to have cleaned the carpet, but she didn’t. Netizen: Terrible.

He messaged me on Instagram asking for my WeChat account, and then he started asking me out and flirting with me. We went out for three meals: he paid for the first one, I paid for the second, and for the third one he asked me to go Dutch (at Hai Di Lao). Because I’m a dancer, I often have rehearsals. On November 14th, he kept asking me about my plans for the evening, and I told him I had rehearsals. He said he wanted to bring us boba, and he was there during the rehearsal. After the rehearsal, he found my good friend (code name cc) on Instagram and asked for her WeChat account, and started chatting with her. His words were exactly the same as when he first asked me out. On the evening of November 14th, we ran into each other at a party. He helped me and cc open the car door, and even wanted to give umbrellas to us and two other colleagues. At the party, he kept trying to play with cc, and then gave her half of the napkin plate and gave me the other half. My story ended there, but then more victims came forward and told me: Author’s criticism of this event\rCan some guys stop flirting with me while trying to hit on my best friend at the same time? Dude, you can do whoever you want, but don’t talk to me every day and then bring me a milk tea when you heard I had a rehearsal, and then go and choose my best friend. Who do you think you are? I’ve never seen anyone get off a car and open the door for both me and my best friend at the same time. Is it the Chinese culture you’ve learned? Everyone gets a share? You even split the tissue in half for me and my best friend. I don’t care who you want to mess with, but if you want to flirt with me and my best friend at the same time, I suggest you stop thinking like that. I don’t want to spoil the atmosphere when many people were drinking yesterday, but I haven’t met a guy who wants to mess with sisters for almost a year. I almost forgot how it feels to be angry. @david luo1115 Summary of the incident: Flirt with me first. Bring us drinks when you heard we were rehearsing. Watch us rehearse. Follow my best friend’s Instagram and start chatting with her. Meet us at night and open the car door for both me and my best friend. You don’t have to do that. The tissue is so small, why did you even split it in half? Don’t even think about choosing a queen. I really have a bad temper.

Luo Junzhe used to have a lot of connections in Irvine, and the girls there all knew each other. When Luo Junzhe lived in Irvine, he lived in someone else’s apartment but boasted that he rented it himself, and said that he was studying in San Diego, but he just liked Irvine, so he bought a house here and mingled in the homeowner group to get close to other girls as a roommate. Regarding prostitution, when Luo Junzhe had just broken up with his girlfriend and his new relationship was not going well, he asked a friend to drive him to SG for prostitution (a round trip of two hours), and the key point is that he went four times a week!!! But Luo Junzhe’s meals cost less than 20 yuan, so where did he get the money for four prostitutes? It turned out that Luo Junzhe made his friend pay for his prostitution expenses, and even ordered expensive ones. In addition, when Luo Junzhe was with his ex-girlfriend, he cheated on her with a guy from LA who lived downstairs from his ex-girlfriend on the third floor while she lived on the fifth floor. Luo Junzhe said he was taking out the trash and happened to run into a friend on the third floor, and even walked his dog with him. When his ex-girlfriend came down to look for him, she caught them. Luo Junzhe desperately lied, saying he was taking out the trash and just happened to run into a friend and even introduced two girls and added them on WeChat. And these were all things that Luo Junzhe personally told his friend A. Later, Luo Junzhe rented a single room for 550 yuan per month, but there was no air conditioning. Luo Junzhe said that the summer was too torturous, so he moved directly to Brother A’s house. Brother A bought a property as an investment and also lived there, so there was an empty room. At Brother A’s house, Luo Junzhe didn’t pay a penny for water, electricity, rent, and sometimes even Brother A had to treat him to a meal. Otherwise, he would say, “This is not worth it, that is not worth it.” Since Brother A wanted to eat, he had to treat Luo Junzhe, which was like Brother A supporting him. During winter vacation, Brother A was preparing to go out of state for a trip, and Luo Junzhe was left alone at Brother A’s house. Brother A repeatedly urged him that if he wanted to bring someone back home, he must tell Brother A. Luo Junzhe promised, but when Brother A returned home, he found yellow hair on his bed, as well as a girl’s hair tie and hairpin. After confronting him, Luo Junzhe admitted that he had brought his girlfriend back, but she had black hair, not yellow. Furthermore, Luo Junzhe often showed off Brother A’s car. When he first got the car, he even asked Brother A for a photo of it. Then they went out together and posted five photos on social media, two of which were of Brother A’s car. (There are many more details, but I’m too tired to type them out.)

Brother B: He had just broken up and came to Irvine to visit me. He stayed at my place for over a month and every time he wanted to date someone, he stayed at my place. I told him I was moving in October, but he didn’t offer to help me move until after I had already moved. Later I found out that he had made plans with someone else and had nowhere to stay. Brother B: 😅 I live in a studio by myself, but he would come over every few days. Later, I bought a box of 24 bottles of water and he finished it in a day and a half. My car was stolen and I asked him to help me move two boxes of water, but he said I was stingy. 😄 Conversation 2 between Brother B and the author\rBrother B: There are a lot of outrageous things about him. Brother B: Basically, my friends and I know about some of his outrageous things. Brother B: We didn’t say anything before because we were friends. Brother B: Seeing the exposure that he tried to seduce someone who had a boyfriend is not outrageous. Brother B: He even tried to seduce someone else’s wife. Author: ??? Brother B: 😇 Conversation between Brother B and the author 3\rBrother B: 😄 I said I didn’t have a car and it was inconvenient. He said, “Oh, I thought you were so stingy. It turns out that’s why.” Damn, I didn’t even ask you to pay, just help me out a little. Besides, you drank most of it, so it’s not a big deal, right? 😅 Brother B: Then when I was living in PP, he came to my place and not long after, he joined the homeowner’s group and started preparing for the hunt. Brother B: I have light sleep, and I caught him going through my phone while I was sleeping. 🙂 Brother B: Anyway, there’s a lot more. I’ll remember and tell you later. Conversation between Brother B and the author 4\rBrother B: My friend and I concluded that this person is just pure garbage. We used to think he just couldn’t figure out the relationship between men and women, but now we know he’s rotten to the core. Brother B: He likes to show off without any capital, and he likes to take advantage of others. He likes to take advantage of small benefits. Brother B: I advised the girls he was trying to hit on to stay away from him, but he said I was a dark person or something. In fact, if I were to reveal everything I know about him, he would be socially dead. 😅 I’m just giving him a break because he used to be my buddy for five years. Brother B: I sent you all these things just for fun. This guy is just pure garbage and a bad person. Okay, let’s continue with this story from my good friend: He used to hang out with my good friend’s ex-girlfriend and one time while drinking, he said he wanted to sleep with her for a night, promising not to do anything. Here’s another story from my male friend: He and my male friend were both pursuing the same girl, and he would brag every day about how they had broken up peacefully. But that wasn’t the case, after the breakup, he kept messaging the girl who didn’t want to talk to him, and even apologized to my friend, saying she regretted being with that idiot. I can confirm that he always bragged about breaking up peacefully because when we hung out together, he would often use it as a topic of conversation and spread rumors, pretending that someone had taken his object of affection away from him. His pretentious behavior is really incomprehensible.

He later uploaded the video and photos to a group with over 100 members called “Pan-Pacific International Military Tribunal”. The group members gathered together to fantasize about the girl in the black stockings, using insulting and objectifying language such as “200 dollars to rip it off”, “suck it”, “love to wear black stockings, little sister~~” and so on. After the dinner, Zhao Yucheng continued to follow the girl to the subway station, constantly updating her video in the group. Finally, he obtained the girl’s WeChat and shared it with the members of the group. The members of the group were all male students from the 26/25/24th grades of New York University. The group name has been changed several times because of the obscene comments against women in the group, and the group has been shut down several times. On that day, Zhao Yucheng was wearing his girlfriend’s Parsons school uniform and wearing her hair tie. He took out his phone and secretly filmed the black stockings of a girl in front of him while everyone at the New York University Christian Church was reading the Bible, disregarding the feelings of his girlfriend and the privacy of the stranger. After being exposed, he changed his name to 26 CAS Yang Jiechi, and in some groups, his account name was changed from “command_ps” to “contra_wind” to avoid attention.

All of these comments are false and completely contrary to the facts. The girlfriend was shocked and angered by all the groundless and malicious rumors. It was revealed that on March 7, 2023, Zhao Yucheng forcefully closed the door, trapping his girlfriend’s fingers and causing serious bleeding, bruising, and suspected bone fractures. He had to take time off to go to the hospital for X-rays (with photos of his injured hand and medical records attached). On April 11, 2023, Zhao Yucheng beat his girlfriend for about ten minutes in their room and took away her phone, preventing her from communicating with friends. He even covered her mouth and nose with his hand, attempting to suffocate her, while she begged for mercy (with photos of her injuries and chat records with friends asking for help attached). On April 16, 2023, during an argument, Zhao Yucheng slammed his girlfriend’s head against the wall, causing her to suffer a minor concussion, and prevented her from seeking help from her roommates and neighbors. All of the descriptions provided by Zhao Yucheng and his friends are extremely absurd and completely contrary to the facts. The girlfriend’s family has always respected the relationship between Zhao Yucheng and the girlfriend and has never interfered excessively. The girlfriend’s family does not have Zhao Yucheng’s contact information, and there is no moral blackmail or harassment from the girlfriend’s family.

Four weeks into the relationship, Zhao played Texas Hold’em with his friends but deceived his girlfriend, claiming they were just having dinner as friends. On November 13, 2022, Zhao Yucheng chatted with a female student from New York University Shanghai and had a suspected ambiguous relationship. Zhao Yucheng made multiple late-night calls to the female student, complaining that his girlfriend was abusing him (which was not true). His girlfriend repeatedly asked him to delete the ambiguous female student, but Zhao Yucheng added her back and continued to deceive his girlfriend. When his girlfriend found out and confronted him, Zhao Yucheng became emotional and verbally abused her and her friends, saying things like “Who do you think you are?

On September 10, 2022, despite knowing that he had tested positive for antigens, he still ignored the risk of indirect transmission and the health of others, and went out to have dinner and play with many friends, spending a long time in a closed space with many people. In the incident, Zhao Yucheng did not believe in Christianity, and his participation in the church dinner organized by the school was purely for free food. Before attending the party, he told his girlfriend, “I’m going to have a free dinner.” However, he secretly filmed a girl in black stockings while many people were reading the Bible in the Christian church. This shows that Zhao Yucheng does not respect others’ religious beliefs and personal privacy. He used other people’s photos to satisfy his and his friends’ perverse tendencies and desires, and also hurt his girlfriend, who was kept in the dark throughout the whole process. Contrary to the image of a wealthy and handsome second-generation overseas student portrayed by Zhao Yucheng’s friends, he is actually vain and pursues luxury brand purchases, but all his clothes are replicas.

During this relationship, I devoted a lot of time and money taking care of her daily life. However, she repeatedly took advantage of my feelings for her to blackmail me, depriving me of my personal freedom, social rights, and privacy. This caused me tremendous physical and mental harm. Knowing that she was in the wrong, the other party fabricated false accusations against me in an attempt to shift all responsibility onto me and cover up the truth about what she did in the relationship. It is the villain who accuses first, and I have always been extremely tolerant and forgiving towards her. Now I will explain the unreasonable accusations made against me by the other party in two parts, and reveal the truth about her repeatedly overstepping boundaries in the relationship. Justice lies in people’s hearts, and facts speak louder than eloquence. I hope that friends can think independently and not be misled by rumors. I reserve the right to hold the other party legally accountable for any harm caused by her defamation. I admit that I was wrong regarding the first item in the PDF, which caused great distress to the victim. Previously, my ex-girlfriend controlled my WeChat and personal freedom, preventing me from participating in offline activities or communicating online with friends independently, and my WeChat records were also monitored and restricted. Therefore, I was unable to contact the victim in time to explain. Now I am in touch with the victim to sincerely apologize, and I also hereby publicly apologize to the victim and anyone who has seen this matter. I did not respect women or consider the distress and emotional impact this would have on the victim. Please forgive me. Regarding the rest of the content in the PDF, the other party has distorted the truth and fabricated facts without providing legitimate evidence to prove the involvement of both parties. Most of the content is personal fabrication without sufficient supporting details or justification. The parts that slander me are completely fictional. All the statements are piling up lies on a minor issue to attack me, the victim. The other party has long been taking psychiatric medications (such as escitalopram) and has a history of severe depression and schizophrenia. She often self-suggests due to dissatisfaction with life or things she dislikes, exacerbating her mood swings and having violent outbursts, often yelling at me, threatening suicide, and damaging my belongings and physically attacking me. She would often check my phone without permission while I was asleep, confiscate my phone, secretly block her disliked friends using my phone, and impersonate me to send messages forbidding them from contacting me without my knowledge. She forced me to cut off and block my friends. She would also often smash things without warning, throwing everything around her on the ground or at me, causing me tremendous mental trauma. Two of my computers, a game console and a monitor were damaged to varying degrees.

However, outside, she constantly slandered and defamed C, creating a false image of herself as a victim of C’s mistreatment. During their cohabitation, C bore all the daily expenses and rent, while Ms. Yan turned things around and fantasized about claiming that she was the one supporting C. She even threatened C, saying that if he didn’t pay her, she would slander and distort the truth. After the final breakup in June 2022, C and Ms. Yan’s relationship had completely broken down. Several months later, Ms. Yan told C that she was already seven or eight months pregnant and had no source of income or ability to take care of herself during the pregnancy. C took Ms. Yan to the hospital for a check-up, confirming the pregnancy. Due to Ms. Yan’s situation, C agreed to temporarily move back in to take care of her until the child was safely born. However, because their relationship had already broken down, they could not provide a happy home for the child. Ms. Yan and C agreed that C would be responsible for choosing a happy foster home for the child and that Ms. Yan would not breastfeed the child. Expense bill 1\rExpense bill 2\rAfter the child was born, he was adopted and taken care of by a LA Asian couple. However, Ms. Yan suddenly changed her mind and wanted the child back, using this as a way to force C to reconcile with her. Ms. Yan promised C that she would never again engage in illegal activities such as drug use, prostitution, and theft. However, when the child returned, Ms. Yan was still immersed in her drug-induced fantasies, failing to feed or change the child on time, even leaving the child in urine after getting high on drugs, in a room filled with gas cylinders. When C came home from work and saw all this, he was furious. However, he still insisted on bathing the child, changing his diaper, and feeding him to ensure the child’s health and safety.

My hospital records prove that I have always been resistant to unprotected sex and I even promised to take responsibility if I became pregnant. Secondly, the paternity test result is 99.99% certain that he is the father of the child, but when he went to the hospital, he claimed that he had no medical insurance and could not afford to raise the child with his income of 2,000 yuan, so he requested that the child be fostered. The doctor can testify to this. Thirdly, out of mutual respect, I did not reveal the child’s surname to any relatives or friends. I have repeatedly stated that I am a new mother and I can afford it financially, but I also hope that he will take responsibility as a father. However, he said that the child and I were dragging him down, and even asked me to seek a psychologist to cope with it. Call records can prove this. Fourthly, he believed that my lifestyle would affect the child’s health, but during the hospitalization, I underwent a comprehensive screening and consulted with doctors. After the child was born, a comprehensive examination was also conducted, and there were no problems. Medical records can prove this. Fifthly, two days before the child’s death, I had already informed him that the child and I were both sick. He believed that I was the natural guardian of the child, so everything he did was extra help. In fact, he and I shared half of the guardianship responsibility, but he was unwilling to take responsibility. Sixth, he did not pay me any compensation for the pregnancy, and after my child and I passed away, he used the child to justify his actions and avoid taking responsibility. He knew my whereabouts but did not sympathize with my pain of losing a child. Instead, he saw it as an opportunity to avoid being reported and mistreated me while slandering me. Essentially, he is an irresponsible, finger-pointing, selfish, petty, photo-editing, and STD-infected person. Despite his irresponsibility, he still pretends to be perfect and even applies for a restraining order, which is truly ridiculous. Excerpt 1\rThe branded girlfriend bought him a Ferrari, which he paid for with a loan. He had to pay 2,000 RMB per month for the car loan and had no medical insurance. During the pregnancy, the girlfriend suggested doing a DNA test, but the man ignored the safety of the pregnant woman during the eight months of pregnancy. After the child was born, the man said that he could not afford to raise the child and wanted to give the child to someone else, but the woman did not agree. So, the man left the child with the single girlfriend and disappeared, only offering to compensate her with 40,000 RMB. During the postpartum period, the girlfriend was weak and sick, and the child’s condition was also very serious, eventually leading to death. The man had been drinking outside all the time, claiming to be doing business, but he had always owed financial support and had never taken care of the girlfriend and the child. Afterwards, the man said that the girlfriend had killed his child by neglecting to take care of it. The girlfriend, for personal safety and emotional reasons, decided to leave the country and return home. In order to continue pretending to be rich and to find more girls to pay for him, the man distorted the truth and even accused the girlfriend of being on the run. He promised to help the girlfriend handle things, but in reality, he only dealt with the things that were jointly owned, and he did not even send back the girlfriend’s personal belongings. The man also lied that the girlfriend had already fled back to her country, and even concealed her positive Covid test result, claiming that she had an STD.

After that, Ms. Yan harassed C’s friends through various channels and published a defamatory article about C. In fact, “exposure article” was first published by Ms. Yan, but all the content in the article was fabricated and had no evidence. Later, C had to refute and clarify this so-called “exposure article” to reveal the truth to everyone. The reason why this article was widely spread on the Internet was that Ms. Yan’s actions were too extreme, which had seriously challenged people’s values. Secondly, Ms. Yan claimed that C had put the child in foster care without permission and slandered C by saying “the child and Ms. Yan dragged C to get rich”. In fact, this was completely made up by Ms. Yan. After the child was born, Ms. Yan clearly stated that she would not breastfeed the child. Before the child was born, the two parties had already agreed to find a responsible adoptive family for the child to have a better future, which was a consensus between the two parties, not just C’s idea. Regarding the choice of adoptive family, Ms. Yan never participated. C found an Asian couple living in Los Angeles who took great care of the child and were very concerned about the child. When they saw the child for the first time, they cried and even built a playground in their backyard. After the child was adopted, Ms. Yan, who had sole custody, took the child back without consulting with C (according to local laws in the United States, the child’s mother has the right to take back the child within a specified period of time). During this period, Ms. Yan repeatedly promised and swore to C that she would quit drugs, take good care of the child, and even raised the reason to “not deprive her of her rights as a mother”. Chat Record\rYan Yuqi: I can’t sleep. Yan Yuqi: After having a son, I promise you that I won’t do drugs. Yan Yuqi: I won’t encourage you anymore. Yan Yuqi: Ta. Yan Yuqi: Laborer. Yan Yuqi: Husband. Yan Yuqi: I’ll change. Yan Yuqi: This way, your two years won’t be wasted. Guarantee\rGuaranteed not to use drugs after having a child.\rBut after the child was taken back, Ms. Yan still did not keep her so-called promise and continued to harass C every day, until he had urinary and fecal incontinence. Urinary and fecal incontinence\rSince C and Ms. Yan are not in a marital relationship and have not established any marriage relationship, the custody of the child belongs only to the child’s mother. After being threatened with a knife by Ms. Yan, C attempted to seek help from lawyers and social workers to fight for custody of the child, but was told that these legal actions would take time to complete.

So I still need to talk with her first to see what happen now One day, when C returned to Yan’s residence after work, he saw a shocking scene.
