<h3 id="concealing-marriage">Concealing Marriage</h3>
<p>He concealed his marital status from me from the time he came from China to Canada, and made me promise not to tell anyone, including my parents. His mother had already known about his marital status. From the beginning of our acquaintance, he was a playful boy, and we often shared locations, so I often checked what he was doing and where he was going. I noticed that he was almost always out with his friends every week, even playing murder mystery games or drinking at bars until the early morning hours before coming home. At that time, I never questioned or doubted him, I just thought he was out with his friends. In fact, during the time we were together, he was unclear about his situation with several girls, chatting with them privately or going out with them, but I always chose to believe him. Later, he began to meet me frequently, and we almost met every day, and we spent almost every day together in a month, which made me think he had changed.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the domestic violence first, and then slowly scroll down.</p>

<h3 id="before-going-abroad">Before Going Abroad</h3>
<p>When he was still in China, he was very good to me. Although we had arguments sometimes, we also had happy times. At first, he treated me and my family well, like a family. My mom really liked him and always praised him for being sensible. I fell into his sweet words and caring inquiries from the beginning. He was good at treating girls, and he was used to it. He often ordered takeout for me, took me out to play, gave me flowers, and always came to see me. Now I realize that his intention was too obvious. No one will be nice to you for no reason. Also, don&rsquo;t be confused by sudden material things. He will suddenly be nice to you and to others. When I got my marriage certificate, we agreed to keep it a secret. He went home very happily that day, but his mom actually saw it in the drawer while cleaning. He said he did something very important that day, and his mom asked if he would regret it. He said confidently that he would not. He also promised me that he had prepared everything and would propose to my mom. I said okay, I would wait for him.</p>
<p>In the months before going abroad in April 2022, I was always locked up in his house because of the pandemic, and we were together day and night. His parents were very nice to me too. I always observed what he liked to eat and what he wanted to buy. Before, when we went on a date, I had a notebook to record my feelings, what happened when we went out, whether it was happy or not, what he liked to eat and what he liked. After I finished writing, I stopped recording. I secretly bought him something he really wanted before going abroad. He even posted a WeChat Moment about it, and I was really happy at that time. He used to post WeChat Moments actively and asked me why I didn&rsquo;t post. Everything changed after going abroad.</p>
<p>The first time the flight he booked for me was cancelled, and I was originally planning to take a taxi home that day. He suggested that we go home together since the flight was cancelled. I burst into tears in the car and immediately turned back to go home with him, thinking that we could be together for a few more days. The second time, I helped him pack his luggage and sent him to the airport. I really missed him. Before he left, he changed his phone wallpaper to my photo and said, &ldquo;I want you to be happy for a few more days.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t realize that my nightmare was about to begin, I only felt sad about his departure. He has changed completely after going abroad, becoming extremely selfish and only wanting to make himself happy.</p>

<p>What I dislike the most about him is that he has been lying to me from the beginning, creating a false persona. Later, when I found out the truth, he told me that it&rsquo;s normal for boys to brag. From childhood to adulthood, everything he said was a lie, like his mother driving a Porsche 911 and his father driving an AMG (but in reality, his mother doesn&rsquo;t even know how to drive, and his father is a ride-hailing driver). He likes to show off his wealth in front of classmates, cares a lot about his reputation, and has a strong sense of vanity, wanting to portray himself as a &ldquo;rich second generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never cared whether he really had these material things or not, I just wanted to live a simple and happy life with him. I hoped he could tell me the truth. When I first met him, his name and age were both fake. My mom and I called him by his fake name for months. Because I was obedient and believed everything he said. He thought I was obedient and didn&rsquo;t want to deceive me, so he told me the truth but asked me not to tell my mom. I promised him, but I secretly told my mom, and one day she accidentally called him by his real name. He was angry with me for breaking my promise and told my mom.</p>
<p>I spent two birthdays with him, and everyone could see how much effort I put into it and how much love was in my eyes, but he only became more and more distant towards me.</p>
<h3 id="npd-narcissistic-personality-disorder">NPD Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h3>
<p>I accidentally came across an article about NPD personality disorder and found that the behavior of the person in question matches this type of narcissistic personality disorder.</p>

<h3 id="blocking-moments">Blocking Moments</h3>
<p>After he went abroad in April 2022, his mother told me that he always reminded her to cook something delicious for me. The reality was that he met Xiaoc while he was in the UK, and then he blocked my Moments, pretending to be single. On one hand, he pretended to be good to me in front of his mother, and on the other hand, he went out with Xiaoc every day, going to her dormitory to cook and wash dishes for her, and frequently picking fights with me. He even sent me photos of him eating and playing with Xiaoc, which was very hurtful. I was tortured for half a year while he was still in China. Xiaoc was exposed after she returned to China and told me that it was dealt with, but he actually just deleted Xiaoc. This time, I forgave him. Our classmates watched him play with two girls in China and abroad, but did not expose the fact that he was married.</p>
<p>He watched Douyin and Xiaohongshu all day long, liked posts from other girls in front of me, talked big in front of me, chatted with so-called female friends on his phone, pretended to be friends with girls on video calls in front of me, and even scolded me for making a fuss. Before he came to the UK to meet me, he had flirted with countless girls through voice and video calls, and had frequent affairs. Here are our chat records:</p>

<h3 id="puaing-me-in-the-uk">PUAing me in the UK</h3>
<p>I went to the UK once, and he was always bargaining and forcing me to go Dutch. Later, I applied for a dependent visa to go to the UK to see him, but he said that no one wanted me to come and that I had to pay for my own visa and airfare. After I arrived, he bad-mouthed me in front of his classmates, and everyone could see his perfunctory attitude towards me. In the dormitory, he squeezed me all the time, saying that I was not good at anything, neither in skills nor in personality. He even said that I was affecting his studies. In terms of travel, he made me go Dutch, saying that all his classmates did the same.</p>
<p>He told me that it was really good to cook and take care of your boyfriend every day, and then he kept using these things to stimulate me. Although I admit that I am not good at cooking, I also help with washing dishes and cleaning up garbage. I think that since we are a couple, these are mutual things, and there is no need to be jealous of others. He knew that I was introverted and didn&rsquo;t like to talk, but he always argued with me in various situations, asking me why I didn&rsquo;t speak, and even forced me to make him happy. When I was unhappy, he would blame me for being weak. He didn&rsquo;t allow me to post our photos or videos on any platform because he wanted to pretend to be single and didn&rsquo;t want other girls to know that he already had a girlfriend. He even said that even if other girls actively approached him, he didn&rsquo;t have to tell me, which I found very unreasonable.</p>
<h3 id="getting-angry-on-the-train">Getting Angry on the Train</h3>
<p>Once, we went to Daxi for fun, and he promised to take pictures with me. When we got there and I asked to take pictures, he refused. I said to him, &ldquo;You promised me before, and now you don&rsquo;t want to take pictures?&rdquo; Seeing my disappointed look, I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to cry. He repeatedly refused me, making me very sad. On the way, he was also unhappy and forced me to say things that would make him happy.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;I know I shouldn&rsquo;t force you. If you don&rsquo;t want to take pictures, forget it.&rdquo; I pushed him while crying, telling him not to be angry anymore, but he was still angry. He wanted me to talk and forced me to say something useful to make him happy. But I couldn&rsquo;t, and his expression was grim, and he still wasn&rsquo;t happy. An old lady next to us saw this scene and reported us to the police. After the train stopped, me, him, and his two classmates were questioned by the police.</p>
<p>The police saw me crying and asked if I had been physically harmed. As his girlfriend, I could clearly say that I would be hurt if he treated me badly. But to protect him, I told the police that it was just a minor quarrel between lovers, and I was too sensitive, so I cried. The police questioned us for a while and then left. But on the way back home, he shouted loudly in front of his classmates, telling me to get out. I told his friends that it was a small matter, and we could communicate well and wait for his comfort. His attitude gradually improved, and after his classmates left, he punched me and said that I had embarrassed him.</p>
<p>I kept apologizing, saying that I knew I was wrong and would not do it again. Every time he was in a good mood, we got along well. But every time we quarreled, he became emotionally excited, said hurtful things, and accused me of doing things he didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<h3 id="second-domestic-violence-incident">Second Domestic Violence Incident</h3>
<p>The second incident occurred in a hotel in London on December 6th. I found out that he had blocked me from seeing his WeChat Moment. He had done this before, and I was unhappy about it, so I asked him why he did it. He said he didn&rsquo;t like me looking at his WeChat Moment, so he turned it off for me. I cried and told him to give me back the ability to see his WeChat Moment. He refused and then proceeded to commit an act of domestic violence against me. He covered me with a blanket and choked me, telling me to shut up. I almost suffocated and begged him to let go. He finally let go when he saw the bruises on my face. The pain of that night is something I will never forget because my parents had never hit me before.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he poured a glass of water on my head and asked me if I had calmed down. He also asked me how he could make it up to me and what he could do to redeem himself. I said I hadn&rsquo;t thought about it yet and would let him know when I did. However, there was no follow-up on this redemption. I didn&rsquo;t see any sincere apologies, and my heart felt empty. The next day, I wore a mask and endured the pain. When he saw the severe bruising around my eyes, he asked me to buy some band-aids to put on them. We went out to eat afterwards, but I felt very uncomfortable when we entered the restaurant, afraid that people would see the bruises on my face. I didn&rsquo;t speak during the meal, and his two friends didn&rsquo;t dare to say anything either. When I took off my mask to eat, everyone saw the bruises on my face. Even though my face was in pain while I was eating, I endured it and finished the meal.</p>

<h3 id="record-in-egypt">Record in Egypt</h3>
<p>From November 12th to 19th, we went to Egypt for a trip. At the airport, his classmate saw that my eyes and lips were swollen and I was wearing a mask. His classmate asked him if he had abused me and spoke up for me, but he immediately denied it, and I lowered my head and didn&rsquo;t dare to speak, and then he kept defending himself.</p>
<p>In Egypt, we had to sit on the bus for a long time every day and walk a lot. I kept coughing and sleeping most of the time on the bus, and my body was uncomfortable. He blamed me for sleeping all the time and even complained that I slept alone.</p>
<p>At night, I was still coughing, and sometimes had severe coughing fits. The tour guide saw me suffering so much and secretly bought a bottle of cough syrup for me. Because we lost our luggage on the first day, we had to buy new clothes. My health improved a lot, and every day I had to wash our personal clothes in the bathroom and let him wear the newly changed clothes, but I never heard a thank you from him.</p>
<h3 id="chatting-with-female-friends">Chatting with Female Friends</h3>
<p>He had just celebrated his birthday, Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and our anniversary (February 14th and 15th), and I suggested that we go out to dinner to celebrate, but he was not willing to. Even though he was with me every day, he would still privately message female friends in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>So I contacted this girl, and she clearly told me that my boyfriend had contacted her first and that the content of the conversation was disgusting. He told me that this was how good friends talked to each other.</p>
<p>We also had a fight once, and he wanted to send me back to my home country. He tore up the gifts, cards, and marriage certificate I had given him and threw them on the ground. I sat on the ground crying until I broke down, picking up the pieces and trying to put them back together. But he told me to stop crying, which was really annoying. After I felt a little better, he told me that he would reissue the certificate for me and stick them back together. In the end, it was me who brought the bag of broken pieces back to my home country and put them back together.</p>
<p>My heart was hurt, and the next day he suddenly told me that he didn&rsquo;t want to talk to me anymore and didn&rsquo;t plan to send me away (seems hypocritical, but not sure what he was going to do). His relationship with that female friend even caused me to feel cold-hearted.</p>

<h3 id="forcing-me-to-return-home">Forcing Me to Return Home</h3>
<p>During our trip, we had another argument and he forced me to return home. In March and April, our travel schedule was full. On the 14th to 17th of April, we had a fight because I didn&rsquo;t speak up, and I cried and sought help from my mother. He told my mother that I should return home, or it would affect his studies and mood. He locked down his WeChat Moment again. After that, he used PUA on me, asking me to obey him once. Every time we argued, I would apologize, and he said he didn&rsquo;t need to apologize as long as I did something that made him happy. We argued until after five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and he said we didn&rsquo;t need to go to France and Switzerland anymore, and it was all my fault. I had to admit that I was wrong, and promised to be good and not make him unhappy. After that, he stopped getting angry with me. His mother kept asking him when I would return home, and we had already planned all our travel arrangements. I said I would travel to France and Switzerland in early April and then return home. We had booked hotels, plane tickets, and tickets for France and Switzerland, and we had already paid for them. We had booked three hotels, and only one could be refunded, so I applied for a refund. My mother told him privately that I didn&rsquo;t go on the trip, and it wasted a lot of money. He agreed to compensate me and said he wouldn&rsquo;t know if I didn&rsquo;t tell him. He asked me where he could stay for the last two days. I gave him the refunded money.</p>
<p>My mother had been troubled by our quarrels for several days, which caused her to have premature ventricular contractions. I listened to her and bought a return ticket. Before I left, he told me he wanted to go with me, and we could travel together. I said the plane ticket was expensive, and I didn&rsquo;t have any extra money. I didn&rsquo;t want to waste so much money. He said he would go out to buy groceries after returning to the dormitory and travel with his classmates the next time, and travel alone.</p>
<h3 id="indifferent-attitude">Indifferent Attitude</h3>
<p>After I returned to China, he became very indifferent to me. Whenever I asked him a question, he would reply with just two words, and it would take him several hours to reply. I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. He didn&rsquo;t respect his wife and didn&rsquo;t value me.</p>
<p>I told my mother about the domestic violence I experienced and also told the female friend that we had already obtained our marriage certificate. She was shocked to hear this. When he went to Switzerland for a vacation, his grandfather fell ill. He called the girl he called &ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; but she didn&rsquo;t miss him. The girl was very angry and replied to his comments on social media to resist social scum. He was very angry and attacked me, asking me what my purpose was in contacting her, causing her to be scolded by her friends and our relationship to break. He kept complaining that I was looking for trouble as soon as I returned to China, and I was forced to end my trip early. I have been enduring his oppression, reminding him to have boundaries, but he started chatting with other people as soon as I returned to China and never changed.</p>
<p>I decided not to indulge in romantic fantasies anymore. I was always sincere to him, often visiting his parents&rsquo; home, never empty-handed, and even bringing food for the cat he raised. Whether in China or abroad, I always gave him gifts on holidays, and even my mother often greeted his mother, but all I got was a story about &ldquo;The Farmer and the Snake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I returned home, my family picked me up at the airport and saw how much weight I had lost and how unhappy I looked. I told them the truth about the domestic violence and other things he had done to me, and my family was very heartbroken and disappointed in him. His mother felt very guilty, and we contacted her in the hope that she would sincerely apologize for the domestic violence or publicly admit that he was already married. If she doesn&rsquo;t consider this issue, then my family won&rsquo;t be soft-hearted. I had given him many chances, and his mother had conveyed his words to us, saying that I was hitting myself and we couldn&rsquo;t prove it was his fault. In his home, he had even disrespected his own father, as his mother admitted, and now it was my turn and my mother&rsquo;s turn. His mother doted on him and was willing to spend a lot of money on him, but he never bought me a nice piece of clothing or shoes. Sometimes, I would suggest that we not buy such expensive things, and he would say, &ldquo;What do you care?&rdquo; He only cared about his own happiness. I thought he would sincerely apologize to me, but that was not the case. What I have described is not just this, there is much more, and his behavior is even worse than what I have said. I have gained nothing from my efforts for him, and he has insulted and belittled my character. I was tolerant of him, but he slandered and defamed me. I feel very heartbroken and suffocated, and now he has even blacklisted me on the entire internet. He is a narcissistic, morally corrupt, heartless, and empty person.</p>
<h2 id="comment">Comment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>James, what do you think?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a typical case of mental control, PUA, and domestic violence. Although I sympathize with the parties involved, the resolution of the relevant issues is still a challenge. Whether in terms of legal principles or academic research, I hope everyone can identify personality defects in relationships and avoid being harmed.</p>
