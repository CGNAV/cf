      <div class="admonition-content">The file does not provide evidence, such as screenshots, and the abbreviation &ldquo;wzy&rdquo; cannot be identified as a real name, so it is difficult to determine the authenticity of the story. Therefore, let&rsquo;s refer to the author as anonymous.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I met wzy in Shanghai in October 2021 and we started living together shortly after. However, during our time together, he often lied and cheated on me.</p>
<h2 id="charge">Charge</h2>
<h3 id="deception">Deception</h3>
<p>The first time she deceived me was in February 2022. During the Spring Festival, we were not together, and she often went to a friend&rsquo;s house to play and would send me videos of cats and other content. However, she always came back late at night. Later, when I went to Jinan to see her in February, I saw her phone album and found out that her ex-boyfriend had been playing with her during that time, and what happened is unknown.</p>
<p>Later, I forgave her. We lived together again in Shanghai from March until we separated in July. Then in August, she secretly met with her ex-boyfriend. When they had dinner with friends, she even video-called her ex-boyfriend and asked him to come back later. I found out about this from her chat records with her friends later.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the key part: at the end of August 2022, because we were studying in different countries, I went to the United States and she went to the United Kingdom. On the first day she arrived in the UK, she blocked me because of a fight, and added me back the next day. In addition, she had been drinking with other people in the apartment and deleted all content related to me on social media. She even used Xiaohongshu to flirt with other guys.</p>
<p>According to statistics, in September alone, 20 guys had already added her to their WeChat Moments, which laid the foundation for our breakup later. In early October, because my UK visa was not approved, wzy started a fight with me and said she wanted to break up. I had to expedite the process. By the end of October, I finally arrived in Glasgow, but when we went out to play cards or eat, we always did it together. However, she told others behind my back that I was her ex-boyfriend, not her current boyfriend. This shocked me, and I had no idea about it.</p>
<p>From October 21st to November 7th, during my time in Glasgow, our relationship can be said to have not diminished at all. When I flew back to the United States last time, she even told me that she missed me and wanted to see me again soon. However, just less than a week after I left, on November 11th, she attended a friend&rsquo;s birthday party with a guy named A who she had previously added on Xiaohongshu, and they even slept together that night. I only found out about this much later, from A and her own admission. But before admitting it, she even swore on her mother&rsquo;s life to prove her innocence. I believed her and flew back to Glasgow from New York on November 13th.</p>
<p>However, when I arrived, she told me that she didn&rsquo;t like me as much anymore and wanted to break up. I naively thought that it was my fault that we didn&rsquo;t work out. Although I respected her decision, I still wanted to see if there was a chance, so I left Glasgow for a friend&rsquo;s house in London that day.</p>
<h3 id="pua">PUA</h3>
<p>In the following two months, she kept seducing me and telling me that all the problems between us were my fault. She continued to use my love and guilt to treat her well while also accepting new pursuer A. Even when she was with A, we still kept in touch frequently. She also had sexual relations with a guy B who had a girlfriend and was A&rsquo;s good friend, which I only found out later, as I was completely ignorant of it before.</p>
<p>When she was about to break up with pursuer A, she kept thinking about me and wanted to reconcile with me. Because she was very good at talking and I loved her very much, I went back to her city for the second time and stayed at her house for the first week.</p>
<p>However, she did not come home for two consecutive nights and I later found out that she had stayed overnight at a friend named B&rsquo;s house. During this period, I had reminded her several times to reply to my messages and videos, and not to deceive or seduce me again. However, such situations occurred again and again, and she slept around like a blackmailing bus, even sending messages and making calls to a group of strange men at a party, pretending to interact with them.</p>
<p>There is also something about a guy named D in her friend circle in Manchester. After they met, they met E and drank and stayed up all night with E in a hotel room during a drinking party, which was the last time she cheated. I had emphasized several times that she should reply to my messages, send videos, and not deceive me anymore, but these problems continued to occur. At the party, she also interacted with a group of unknown men and refused to reply to messages or answer calls.</p>
<h3 id="infidelity">Infidelity</h3>
<p>Later on, the most disgusting thing I found out was at another friend&rsquo;s birthday party. She got drunk and was sent home by her good male friend, C. When I got home, she was lying on the ground. When I checked her phone&rsquo;s chat history, I found that she had a very flirtatious conversation with C. After C sent her home and left, she messaged him, asking him to come and spend 20 minutes with her, and that they didn&rsquo;t need to have sex.</p>
<p>This made me very uncomfortable, but C didn&rsquo;t agree to her request because I was present. The next day, when I questioned her, she told me that she was just joking around because she was drunk.</p>
<p>I have liked her for over a year, not only have I invested a lot emotionally, but I have also gone through a series of experiences and expenses, only to find out that she is just a girl who can be picked up by a man she just met.</p>
<p>To the mother of the female protagonist, I want to say, is this the good daughter you raised? Have you taught her the principles of life? She cheats on her parents and her boyfriend every day, and her values are very twisted. She believes that sleeping with other men during a relationship is a glorious thing, and this is your daughter.</p>
