<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the story: I want to expose a scumbag on behalf of the masses. I haven&rsquo;t encountered such a maddening person in a long time and I just can&rsquo;t take it anymore.</p>
<p>This scumbag is named David Luo Junzhe, a senior computer science student at UCSD.</p>
<h2 id="charge">Charge</h2>
<p>Let me tell you my story first. He messaged me on Instagram asking for my WeChat account, and then he started asking me out and flirting with me. We went out for three meals: he paid for the first one, I paid for the second, and for the third one he asked me to go Dutch (at Hai Di Lao). Because I&rsquo;m a dancer, I often have rehearsals.</p>
<p>On November 14th, he kept asking me about my plans for the evening, and I told him I had rehearsals. He said he wanted to bring us boba, and he was there during the rehearsal. After the rehearsal, he found my good friend (code name cc) on Instagram and asked for her WeChat account, and started chatting with her. His words were exactly the same as when he first asked me out.</p>
<p>On the evening of November 14th, we ran into each other at a party. He helped me and cc open the car door, and even wanted to give umbrellas to us and two other colleagues. At the party, he kept trying to play with cc, and then gave her half of the napkin plate and gave me the other half. My story ended there, but then more victims came forward and told me:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content"><p>Can some guys stop flirting with me while trying to hit on my best friend at the same time? Dude, you can do whoever you want, but don&rsquo;t talk to me every day and then bring me a milk tea when you heard I had a rehearsal, and then go and choose my best friend. Who do you think you are? I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone get off a car and open the door for both me and my best friend at the same time. Is it the Chinese culture you&rsquo;ve learned? Everyone gets a share? You even split the tissue in half for me and my best friend. I don&rsquo;t care who you want to mess with, but if you want to flirt with me and my best friend at the same time, I suggest you stop thinking like that. I don&rsquo;t want to spoil the atmosphere when many people were drinking yesterday, but I haven&rsquo;t met a guy who wants to mess with sisters for almost a year. I almost forgot how it feels to be angry. @david luo1115</p>
<hr>
<p>Summary of the incident:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flirt with me first.</li>
<li>Bring us drinks when you heard we were rehearsing.</li>
<li>Watch us rehearse.</li>
<li>Follow my best friend&rsquo;s Instagram and start chatting with her.</li>
<li>Meet us at night and open the car door for both me and my best friend. You don&rsquo;t have to do that. The tissue is so small, why did you even split it in half?</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even think about choosing a queen. I really have a bad temper.</p>

<h3 id="victim-1">Victim 1</h3>
<p>According to the victim, this girl met a boy in the library and added him on WeChat. The date of adding WeChat is the same as the date when she added me, and even the opening line of the chat was the same video twice. It is important to note that the date was November 17, 2022.</p>

<h3 id="the-third-girl">The Third Girl</h3>
<p>According to the victim&rsquo;s disclosure, this girl had a boyfriend, but she still talked to him when he went to her house and even helped her move things. He even asked the girl to bring him medicine from China and said he wanted to watch the girl play mahjong at home. What&rsquo;s more, this person is also friends with the girl&rsquo;s boyfriend.</p>
<h3 id="the-fourth-girl">The Fourth Girl</h3>
<p>According to the victim, this girl is a good friend of the second and third girls. Their chat content has no substantive communication, and sometimes this girl even shows off to boys, saying how beautiful and good-looking her ex-girlfriends were.</p>
<p>Moreover, she also tells boys that she is good at pursuing girls, and even teaches another boy how to pursue girls. She even often brags that she is very familiar with the girls in the school&rsquo;s KPOP club, but in fact, she has only met them once or even never met them. I don&rsquo;t know why she would say such things that she is very familiar with the girls in the student club. Maybe she thinks that knowing many girls and having had beautiful girlfriends is something she can brag about.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m telling you here, don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of Girls Power. The feelings between girls are something you can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, this person has the following tendencies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Likes to add girls on WeChat and is very interested in chatting with a group of good female friends.</li>
<li>Does not mind whether the girl has a boyfriend, and still talks to them directly.</li>
<li>Boasts that he knows many beautiful girls, even ex-girlfriends.</li>
</ol>

<p>According to the victim, Luo Junzhe (the male lead) once opened a private account because he stole A&rsquo;s clothes. At that time, A&rsquo;s clothes were left in a dry cleaner in Irvine, and A&rsquo;s friend B retrieved the clothes for him, while Luo Junzhe went to stay at B&rsquo;s house. He claimed that he just broke up and wanted someone to accompany him, but in fact, he had contact with too many people he knew in Irvine.</p>
<p>Later, Luo Junzhe went to 88rising just to see his ex-girlfriend and show her his &ldquo;new side&rdquo;. Luo Junzhe was wearing A&rsquo;s clothes from head to toe, and even wanted to wear his shoes, but couldn&rsquo;t fit in. To avoid A from finding out, he blocked A directly while taking photos at 88rising, then unfollowed A and set the account to private. In addition, he also switched A&rsquo;s clothes with another item.</p>

<h2 id="additional-accusations">Additional Accusations</h2>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just the appetizer. Luo Junzhe used to have a lot of connections in Irvine, and the girls there all knew each other.</p>
<p>When Luo Junzhe lived in Irvine, he lived in someone else&rsquo;s apartment but boasted that he rented it himself, and said that he was studying in San Diego, but he just liked Irvine, so he bought a house here and mingled in the homeowner group to get close to other girls as a roommate.</p>
<p>Regarding prostitution, when Luo Junzhe had just broken up with his girlfriend and his new relationship was not going well, he asked a friend to drive him to SG for prostitution (a round trip of two hours), and the key point is that he went four times a week!!! But Luo Junzhe&rsquo;s meals cost less than 20 yuan, so where did he get the money for four prostitutes? It turned out that Luo Junzhe made his friend pay for his prostitution expenses, and even ordered expensive ones.</p>
<p>In addition, when Luo Junzhe was with his ex-girlfriend, he cheated on her with a guy from LA who lived downstairs from his ex-girlfriend on the third floor while she lived on the fifth floor. Luo Junzhe said he was taking out the trash and happened to run into a friend on the third floor, and even walked his dog with him. When his ex-girlfriend came down to look for him, she caught them. Luo Junzhe desperately lied, saying he was taking out the trash and just happened to run into a friend and even introduced two girls and added them on WeChat. And these were all things that Luo Junzhe personally told his friend A.</p>
<p>Later, Luo Junzhe rented a single room for 550 yuan per month, but there was no air conditioning. Luo Junzhe said that the summer was too torturous, so he moved directly to Brother A&rsquo;s house. Brother A bought a property as an investment and also lived there, so there was an empty room. At Brother A&rsquo;s house, Luo Junzhe didn&rsquo;t pay a penny for water, electricity, rent, and sometimes even Brother A had to treat him to a meal. Otherwise, he would say, &ldquo;This is not worth it, that is not worth it.&rdquo; Since Brother A wanted to eat, he had to treat Luo Junzhe, which was like Brother A supporting him.</p>
<p>During winter vacation, Brother A was preparing to go out of state for a trip, and Luo Junzhe was left alone at Brother A&rsquo;s house. Brother A repeatedly urged him that if he wanted to bring someone back home, he must tell Brother A. Luo Junzhe promised, but when Brother A returned home, he found yellow hair on his bed, as well as a girl&rsquo;s hair tie and hairpin. After confronting him, Luo Junzhe admitted that he had brought his girlfriend back, but she had black hair, not yellow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Luo Junzhe often showed off Brother A&rsquo;s car. When he first got the car, he even asked Brother A for a photo of it. Then they went out together and posted five photos on social media, two of which were of Brother A&rsquo;s car. (There are many more details, but I&rsquo;m too tired to type them out.)</p>

<p>Okay, let&rsquo;s continue with this story from my good friend:</p>
<p>He used to hang out with my good friend&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend and one time while drinking, he said he wanted to sleep with her for a night, promising not to do anything.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another story from my male friend:</p>
<p>He and my male friend were both pursuing the same girl, and he would brag every day about how they had broken up peacefully. But that wasn&rsquo;t the case, after the breakup, he kept messaging the girl who didn&rsquo;t want to talk to him, and even apologized to my friend, saying she regretted being with that idiot.</p>
<p>I can confirm that he always bragged about breaking up peacefully because when we hung out together, he would often use it as a topic of conversation and spread rumors, pretending that someone had taken his object of affection away from him. His pretentious behavior is really incomprehensible.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to reveal:</p>
<h3 id="credit-card-fraud-against-roommate">Credit card fraud against roommate</h3>
<p>While living in LA, Luo Junzhe secretly stole his roommate&rsquo;s credit card to purchase gaming equipment. He refused to admit it until his roommate, A, confronted him about it and only returned the money after being asked.</p>
<h3 id="cat-abuse">Cat abuse</h3>
<p>Luo Junzhe has abused cats belonging to his ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s family and his roommates. He would throw the cats from the second floor when his roommates were not home or lock them in the toilet and punch them until they &ldquo;lost control.&rdquo; These actions are extremely cruel.</p>
<h3 id="soliciting-prostitution">Soliciting prostitution</h3>
<p>This has been going on for a long time. When he was with his girlfriend, he would spend a lot of time playing mobile games and sometimes even ask his girlfriend to transfer money to others for prostitution. This behavior is very infuriating.</p>
<h3 id="mooching-off-others">Mooching off others</h3>
<p>When Luo Junzhe is with a girl, she usually has to spend more money, and his ex-girlfriend often pays for meals.</p>
<h3 id="stealing-cash-from-roommates">Stealing cash from roommates</h3>
<p>Also while living in LA, Luo Junzhe went into his roommate B&rsquo;s room and stole a few hundred dollars that B had just earned. However, his behavior was exposed by another roommate, C. Later, C told B and they found the same amount of cash in Luo Junzhe&rsquo;s room. Although Luo Junzhe later returned the money, he still denied that he had stolen it.</p>
<h3 id="overcharging-for-meals-when-splitting-the-bill">Overcharging for meals when splitting the bill</h3>
<p>Previously, when they went out to eat, everyone would pay separately and then transfer the money to the person who paid. However, when Luo Junzhe paid with his credit card, he would lie about the price, for example, claiming that the cost was $25 per person but asking everyone to transfer $35 to him, thus overcharging everyone.</p>
<h3 id="lying-about-internet-fees">Lying about internet fees</h3>
<p>When we rented a house together, Luo Junzhe was responsible for paying the internet fees, but he always lied about the price. For example, he would say that each person needs to pay a few tens of dollars, but in reality, it added up to more than $200. He also wanted to bully everyone to give him more deposit.</p>
<h3 id="borrowing-small-amounts-of-money-and-not-returning-it">Borrowing small amounts of money and not returning it</h3>
<p>Luo Junzhe often borrows small amounts of money ranging from 50 to 200 RMB from friends, but never pays them back. Although it is not much money, he does it frequently, which is annoying.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-friends-online-banking-to-transfer-money-to-his-account-regularly">Setting up friends&rsquo; online banking to transfer money to his account regularly</h3>
<p>Luo Junzhe secretly set up his friend&rsquo;s online banking account to transfer 16 dollars to his account every month. This behavior is not only illegal but also a malicious deception of his friend.</p>
<h3 id="cheating-on-car-insurance">Cheating on car insurance</h3>
<p>Previously, Luo Junzhe encouraged his ex-girlfriend to buy a BMW X5 together, with each person paying half, and they also took out a loan. During this period, when his ex-girlfriend went back to her country, he crashed the car, and although it was only the headlight that was damaged, the repair cost was very high, which led to the car being sold for only $4,000.</p>
<h3 id="secretly-using-cheats-while-gaming">Secretly using cheats while gaming</h3>
<p>When playing the game &ldquo;PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battlegrounds&rdquo; with a few friends, Luo Junzhe would secretly use cheats, making everyone think he was really good at the game. Later, it was discovered that he had been using wallhacks.</p>
