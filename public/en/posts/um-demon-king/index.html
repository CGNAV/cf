<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Fellow men and women, please keep your eyes open and stay away from scumbags! A reminder to those in the Melbourne area:</p>
<p>This person attended Beijing No. 12 High School and was the president of the popular music club. He is currently a second-semester undergraduate student majoring in Data Science at the University of Melbourne, and has plagiarized other people&rsquo;s assignments multiple times during his studies.</p>
<h2 id="charges">Charges</h2>
<p>Here is the revised text:</p>
<p>Classic quote 1: &ldquo;I am a PR, I have a green card. If you encounter any trouble in China, just come to Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Classic quote 2: &ldquo;My father is a representative of a certain company and its founder. He is now dedicated to water conservancy projects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here are some things about him:</p>
<h3 id="school-violence">School Violence</h3>
<p>He had been involved in school violence in high school and was dealt with by the school.</p>
<h3 id="causing-injury">Causing Injury</h3>
<p>Once in a bar, he smashed someone&rsquo;s head and caused injury, which was ultimately resolved through his father&rsquo;s connections and payment of compensation.</p>
<h3 id="skipping-exams">Skipping Exams</h3>
<p>During high school, he basically did not take exams and eventually got a GPA of around 3.8 (out of 5), which was achieved at a certain cost.</p>
<h3 id="violating-traffic-rules">Violating Traffic Rules</h3>
<p>He had driven without a license and violated traffic rules multiple times.</p>
<h3 id="harassing-girls">Harassing Girls</h3>
<p>After getting drunk, he harassed a college girl and caused her to be trapped and depressed. He also harassed other girls multiple times, including his girlfriend and other friends&rsquo; girlfriends.</p>
<h3 id="deceiving-girls">Deceiving Girls</h3>
<p>He had sexual relations with girls but was irresponsible afterward, ignoring his promises to them. He tricked the girl into leaving her home without telling anyone. Three days later, he disappeared. The girl&rsquo;s friend told him to apologize to the girl, but he refused to admit his mistake and distorted the truth. He also tried to accuse the girl of taking his house key without his consent, but the girl had already told him and he agreed to let her have the key to enter his house.</p>
<div class="details admonition quote open">

      <i class="icon fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>Conversation between the author and the scammer<i class="details-icon fa-solid fa-angle-right fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    </div>
    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content"><p>Scammer: So I just said maybe, and you as his friend, as an onlooker, can evaluate my behavior from your perspective. It&rsquo;s okay if you want to comment on me, but it has nothing to do with me. But I still want you to know that from my perspective, I have no reason, and I don&rsquo;t need to, and won&rsquo;t apologize to anyone. So it&rsquo;s okay if you want to talk about this, but you don&rsquo;t have the qualifications or ability to make me apologize.</p>
<hr>
<p>Author: Understood.</p>
<hr>
<p>Author: As a woman, I just feel empathy and want to emphasize the importance of ritual and responsibility to women.</p>
<p>Author: I&rsquo;m just a bit harsh and value this kind of thing. Of course, you&rsquo;re not wrong. I have the right to speak, but the decision is up to you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Scammer: I have made it clear about these things. I still don&rsquo;t understand why you kept letting others into my house without my consent, even when I disagreed, and even gave the key to non-tenants despite reminding you many times.</p>
</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>The fact is: He personally went downstairs to meet the girl.</p>
<h3 id="preventing-subletting">Preventing Subletting</h3>
<p>When his female roommate found out about this, he blocked her from leaving the house and refused to let her sublet.</p>
<p>He repeatedly gave nonsensical reasons to reject the female roommate&rsquo;s search for a new roommate, and subtly hinted that he hoped the female roommate would live with a certain girl. The female roommate refused her request based on the safety and rent issues of that girl, and the girl did not blame the female roommate.</p>
<p>He repeatedly used this excuse to hit on the female roommate.</p>
<p>The female roommate later found other male roommates, but this male roommate was also rejected.</p>
<p>(Even after agreeing to meet, the landlord flew from China to Australia, but he unreasonably refused, causing the landlord to have to change his flight.)</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I am the female party involved in the article &ldquo;Â¢®Â§ßÊ∑∑‰∏ñÈ≠îÁéã‚Ä¶‚Ä¶&rdquo; that was published yesterday. I would like to clarify some things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The article was not submitted by me, and I had no intention of attacking the male party. Due to the lack of timely communication between us, there was a misunderstanding. At that time, my friend planned this venting event to help me release my anger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The content of the article was fabricated by my friend in a moment of impulse, and 90% of it is fictitious. These words were attributed to him based on various bizarre people and events heard in Melbourne. As the female party involved, I hope that everyone will not spread rumors and affect the male party&rsquo;s life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whole incident was caused by a misunderstanding, and it has been resolved well. There should be no further involvement from others, and the male party does not need to explain anything further.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Author: This is not something I posted, bro.</p>
<p>Author: She did it herself.</p>
<p>Author: We had a misunderstanding before. I went to complain to her. I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s doing to make up these things.</p>
<p>Author: I went to the public account and told them, but this thing really wasn&rsquo;t posted by me.</p>
<p>Author: I still can&rsquo;t contact her now. I saw this post yesterday afternoon and messaged her to delete it, but she hasn&rsquo;t replied all day.</p>
<hr>
<p>A: So now you have no problem with it, and your friend is indignant about it? Doesn&rsquo;t she feel disgusted by making up these things with no evidence other than a chat record and some made-up essays? Do you guys believe it yourselves?</p>
<hr>
<p>Author: I know this thing is very harmful to anyone. I really want to resolve this issue now. I contacted the public account to take down this post. Can I help you clarify it?</p>
<p>Author: I have no intention of attacking you personally. I can also help you prove that these things were made up by my friend when I went to talk to her and she was too angry and wanted to mess with you. I didn&rsquo;t know the situation would develop into this.</p>
