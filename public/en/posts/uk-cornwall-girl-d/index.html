<h2 id="international-student-or-not">International Student or Not</h2>
<p>Based on the description, this story seems to take place at a university in the UK.</p>
<p>The main reasons are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Places mentioned in the text like Cornwall are locations in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The currency unit mentioned is British Pound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The text mentions the girl living and studying in the UK, and provides some details about university life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The police and legal procedures mentioned also fit the UK situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall environment and details of the story point towards university life in the UK.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So it can be inferred that this story likely took place at a university in the UK. The specific university cannot be determined from the text. But overall, the story seems to want to reflect the life and experiences of some international students in the UK.</p>
<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Let me reorganize the timeline and general situation of the events to help everyone better understand what happened.</p>
<p>Most of the content here is supported by evidence. Below I will use &ldquo;she&rdquo; or &ldquo;D&rdquo; to refer to the person involved. This story is purely daily life and fun sharing, and should not be elevated to real life. I hope everyone is aware and looks at it rationally.</p>
<h2 id="accusations">Accusations</h2>
<h3 id="extortion">Extortion</h3>
<p>On March 12, after we broke up, I proposed to part on good terms, but she asked me to pay back 8,800 yuan for her plane ticket, claiming that her spending during our relationship was real, while mine did not count. I asked her to show the ticket refund record first before discussing it further, but she refused. So I just ignored it. That night, her sister contacted me, proposing that we settle the accounts, paying back any excess and making up any shortage. I refused repeatedly, but under her sister&rsquo;s repeated request, I compiled the spending records, excluding all joint spending such as taxis and meals, calculating 90% of the total, which came out to 21,000 yuan paid by me. According to paying back any excess, she should have paid me money. Her side then fell silent and I stopped pursuing it.</p>

<p>On March 13, she sent me a threatening letter, mentioning my parents and my father&rsquo;s company name. I was shocked and asked her sister what was going on. Her sister said her younger sister was too young, and asked me to pay 5,500 yuan to settle it. I refused again. This was the first time and I didn&rsquo;t pursue it. The second time we agreed to settle the accounts, paying back any excess and making up any shortage, but when she found out I paid more, she avoided it with silence. The third time she wanted money again, I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t give any. I told her sister that I had her family information, and if they harassed my family again, I would tell her parents. Her sister agreed and also mentioned her younger sister had mental problems. I said then don&rsquo;t tell her I&rsquo;m going to contact the parents, to avoid aggravating her condition. I continued to ignore this matter.</p>

<p>On March 14, she searched for my mother&rsquo;s information again, trying to add her WeChat but was rejected. So I asked her sister again, and got the &ldquo;the child doesn&rsquo;t know any better&rdquo; answer, and asked me to pay 3,300 yuan to settle it. I refused again and warned that if they harassed my family again, I would inform her parents. In the end, I didn&rsquo;t pursue it further.</p>

<p>On March 15, she somehow found my parents&rsquo; phone number (I showed her my phone but didn&rsquo;t let her snoop on my family information), and sent threatening texts to them. My dad forwarded the content to our family group, and my parents were very angry, scolding me for two days. I was furious. Did she forget that she had left her own parents&rsquo; contact information when I helped her mail a package? I contacted her sister to prove I really could contact her parents and it wasn&rsquo;t an empty threat. Her sister realized the severity of the situation, and created a group chat for us to communicate. After she sent the threat, she stopped contacting me, and I didn&rsquo;t contact her either. But when she learned I had my parents&rsquo; contact info, she frantically called me, asking me and my parents to apologize. I said forget it, don&rsquo;t make any more trouble. I thought it was over, but she sent more threats that night, saying I reported her for contract cheating and it would never be over. If I really wanted to report her, I would have done so already, why would I need to contact you?</p>

<p>That night, she threatened me with suicide. Her so-called friend &ldquo;77&rdquo; also threatened me, saying she went to the hospital for blood transfusion and gastric lavage, asking me to see the record. I agreed to see it, but the other party couldn&rsquo;t produce it for half a day, and finally sent a 1,400 pound bill with no details, just the total amount. This &ldquo;77&rdquo; was her alt account, now deleted. The font was the same, also pretending to be her friend threatening me. I don&rsquo;t understand which hospital gives bills like this. Besides, gastric lavage costs over 1,000 pounds? Then I asked her again to provide evidence for the plane ticket, and she hemmed and hawed before sending a blurry photo. She kept asking for money without providing any evidence. I didn&rsquo;t want to bother with her anymore, thinking it was over.</p>

<p>This P4 Yummy Sweet Potato is her alt account, now deleted. The ending characters match her own, and it was deleted directly, how could it not be her own alt? She pretended to be her own friend playing good cop bad cop, calling me a bastard, such low class. The persona of this alt account was a Shanghai gangster, who could get anything done for her in Shanghai.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
<p>In the end, I still exposed her, because she went too far. From friends I learned she had wanted to exploit me fully before dumping me, and was badmouthing me everywhere. Her spending during our relationship only included a tiramisu, one plane ticket, one concert ticket, and a salmon dish. And the ticket price was unclear. She just verbally demanded compensation from me. She also wanted to expose me on Xiaohongshu, so I decided to strike first.</p>

<p>The truth is, I didn&rsquo;t ask for money initially. She kept pursuing me for it, even searching out my parents, but her parents&rsquo; information was given by her. I didn&rsquo;t make it public, only told her sister I really could contact her parents, asking her to stop harassing my family.</p>
<h3 id="false-accusation">False Accusation</h3>
<p>Finally, she kept harassing me, making me hear about some things she had slandered about me, as well as things she had done before. This made me feel she was not a decent person. So I asked her for all my expenses, which was the 44,000 number. But she took it out of context, going to the police saying I had extorted 10,000 pounds from her, so I was inexplicably arrested, charged with blackmailing her and threatening her parents. I was completely speechless and shocked. If she could produce evidence of me demanding 10,000 pounds from her, I would directly transfer 10,000 to her, no problem. I was released the next day. I explained what happened to the police. The police said I could file another report, and they would keep my phone for investigation. Then I saw her testimony was full of lies slandering me, making me feel she was not normal.</p>
<p>As long as she can produce a record of me demanding more than 45,000 from her, I will bite through the iron prison door. That&rsquo;s why I carefully made this PDF for everyone. I was also wrong in this matter, I shouldn&rsquo;t have taken her for a decent person. She told me she was a virgin, but slept with other men during our relationship. Too shameless.</p>
<p>Many people wonder why I didn&rsquo;t break up earlier if I felt something was wrong. Am I an idiot? Yes I am an idiot. I was too merciful, thinking she could still change for the better. But this was before I knew she had slandered me and slept around. Knowing this now, I feel really stupid, being so compassionate towards her. The police have returned my phone to me, saying I&rsquo;m innocent, but they need to subpoena her. However, she escaped back to China, and the police couldn&rsquo;t catch her when they went to her home. So I filed a case in China.</p>
<h3 id="ticket-fraud">Ticket Fraud</h3>
<p>I want to explain the concert ticket incident in detail:</p>
<p>She called me in the morning saying she wanted to see Mr. Wong&rsquo;s concert, and I said I&rsquo;m not into concerts. She insisted on taking me there. I said I didn&rsquo;t know how to use the ticket buying app, and I was busy with some things, we could talk about it later. She kept calling me, teaching me how to buy tickets while screenshotting the process on her phone and sending it to me. She asked me to buy two tickets, but I kept failing. She didn&rsquo;t believe me, asking me to record my screen to prove I couldn&rsquo;t buy them. I recorded and sent it to her. After watching, she said fine, she would buy them. Then she bought one for herself (I was puzzled why she didn&rsquo;t help me buy one if tickets were selling out fast), and kept rushing me to buy quickly. I tried many times but couldn&rsquo;t get in. She said she would help me, asking me to send her my credit card information.</p>
<p>After I sent it to her, she still failed the payment. Then she said slightly mockingly, &ldquo;I used my card to help you buy it, tsk, don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo; Then she screenshotted the 116 pounds and sent it to me, implying I should transfer her the money, and said &ldquo;don&rsquo;t understand you~~&rdquo; before hanging up.</p>
<p>This is how she described it to my friend: &ldquo;This cheapskate, making me buy the tickets, disgusting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really funny. She insisted on taking me to the concert, walking me through buying tickets step-by-step. I couldn&rsquo;t buy them and she grumbled about it. She only bought one ticket in two tries, saying the concert checks ID and she couldn&rsquo;t buy two or I couldn&rsquo;t get in with her ticket. I&rsquo;ve never been to concerts, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m that clueless, am I? In the end, she very reluctantly bought my ticket, still muttering about it. Does she still feel this ATM failed to dispense money?</p>

<p>The funniest thing is, after we broke up she told me: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just give you the ticket. If you want to see me again, it&rsquo;ll be at the concert.&rdquo; I had forgotten about it. She probably wanted me to return the ticket to her. But the next day, I kept receiving ticket refund confirmation codes in my email&hellip; Turns out while saying she gifted me the ticket, she was furiously applying for refunds, even impersonating me to retrieve my password and request a refund. It made me laugh hard while also feeling disgusted by her shameless lies. She also seemed to want to resell my ticket, because I received a ticket transfer confirmation code. It cracked me up. The person who bought my ticket from her even reached out to me. I found out she had given them my account and a fake password. They couldn&rsquo;t log in, realized something was wrong, asked her about it, and she pushed the blame onto the buyer, saying they logged in too late. Then she blamed the buyer for being careless, basically refusing to refund the money. Later the buyer wanted to buy another ticket or get a refund. She said she would buy a 120 pound ticket for the buyer, but wanted the buyer to pay half the price, 60 pounds, trying to extort the buyer again. The buyer didn&rsquo;t agree, and she said to pay at least 10-20 pounds. Even when the buyer gave 10, she still grumbled about why it wasn&rsquo;t 20. She really got money in her eyes.</p>
<h3 id="shopping-bragging">Shopping Bragging</h3>
<p>Regarding the upscale shopping experience, that day we were lining up for a sale at Cartier. She told me that if she took out her ID, Cartier would see her purchase record and immediately invite her inside. I said &ldquo;then take it out&rdquo;. She said &ldquo;too high profile, better not&rdquo;. So we lined up for half an hour before finally buying. Then she went to Chaumet and walked right in. I&rsquo;m not too familiar with Chaumet, just know it&rsquo;s expensive. I was shocked seeing the price tags, starting at tens of thousands of pounds. So I didn&rsquo;t look further and sat to the side. She asked me to look. I said I felt inferior and couldn&rsquo;t stand looking at such things, where anything was millions of pounds. Later she even had the salesperson help her try on a crown said to be worth 10 million pounds! She also said she was preparing to buy one when she returned home. The salesperson said only the UK had it. She said she would ask her mother, because her dowry jewelry budget was only 10 million. She tried it on, took pictures, and posted like she had bought it all. The only thing she really bought was with my money, but she spoke as if she had bought it herself.</p>
<p>But this is how she described it to others: She flashed her ID as soon as she entered, and the store cleared out just for her as a VIP (in reality we lined up at Cartier for half a day, and there was no one at Chaumet). She specifically said I was beneath her, and saw these things as inferior, emphasizing that I was very inferior. I said I felt inferior seeing the prices. But in her story it became that I have an inferior personality and am stupid. I want to ask, how many international students can feel nonchalant seeing things worth tens of millions? If there are any, please leave a comment. I want to learn how to be inferior from each one.</p>
<h3 id="bentley">Bentley</h3>
<p>Regarding the Bentley, that day she said she was going to meet a friend to discuss business. On the way, she sent me a photo of herself sitting in the passenger seat of a Bentley. I recognized it was a Continental GT, so I told her &ldquo;Big Continental GT&rdquo;. She started bragging to me about how rare and precious this car was, saying things like a seat&rsquo;s leather was worth a Hermes bag (which had nothing to do with me, it wasn&rsquo;t my car). She then said she was downstairs of my dorm building and asked me to come down to pick her up. When I went down, there was only her alone (remember, only one person, no one else). She told me &ldquo;If you had come down a bit sooner you could have met my friend.&rdquo; I said no problem, there will be plenty of opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>But this is how she described this incident to others: As soon as this gold-digging man saw my friend&rsquo;s car, he was jumping up and down shouting &ldquo;Wow! A Bentley! Globally limited to 80 units, the second Bentley in the world!&rdquo; Seeing this, my friend immediately rolled up the car window and stepped on the gas and left. And I was still on the side saying &ldquo;Wow! What a nice exhaust sound!&rdquo; She said I was so embarrassing and had never seen the world.</p>
<p>When I heard about this, my thought was: This is almost unimaginable, really?</p>

<h3 id="hainan-ancient-town">Hainan Ancient Town</h3>
<p>There are no ancient towns in Hainan, making it unsuitable for cultural ancient town restoration cultural tourism projects.</p>
<p>My friend had a Shanxi cultural tourism project and wanted me to take a look at whether the plan was reasonable. At the time when she saw it, she took the initiative to suggest going to Hainan to develop this project, saying the daughter of the director of the Hainan Culture and Tourism Bureau had an ironclad relationship with her. I said this was a cultural ancient town restoration cultural tourism project using information technology, with the focus on culture and ancient towns, and Hainan did not have ancient towns so it was not very suitable. But she still emphasized her connections in Hainan and told my friend to go to Hainan to develop this project. My friend said very directly that this project was aimed at the ancient towns and ancient buildings in Shanxi. First, Shanxi has recently introduced favorable policies, and second, Shanxi has a profound cultural heritage. Finally, as a tourist city, Hainan does not have ancient town ruins to do this project.</p>
<p>She still seemed to not understand that the focus of this cultural tourism project was on cultural ancient towns. Instead, she belittled the plan and PPT my friend made, saying that such a plan would get you fired from her company, and claimed no one could compare with Hainan in the field of culture and tourism. I could only tell my friend that if there were relevant projects in Hainan, she could explain to her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Your friend&rsquo;s PPT and plan would get fired directly in my company.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who can compare with Hainan in culture and tourism.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Is your friend close with you? How could she have no eye for things?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She said: &ldquo;I really feel your friend has no taste.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She said: &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t understand how you can do projects without connections like mine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in private, this is what she said about me - This guy kept asking me to invest in projects for him. One look at his plan and you know it won&rsquo;t work. He kept pestering me for investment. I asked how much he wanted directly, and he said one million. It was so annoying. I wanted to tear up that plan. He wanted one million investment for that kind of plan. I almost scolded him right there.</p>
<p>My inner OS: You have to emphasize your investment insight and belittle my friend&rsquo;s project, then say behind my back that I was the one pestering you for investment? This is just drama, I won&rsquo;t even watch the Spring Festival Gala without you. You even said you wanted to invest in my parents&rsquo; company before. Who understands? This is like poking a frog with a bamboo stick, and it goes &ldquo;croak croak&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="fake-tote">Fake Tote</h3>
<p>She wears expensive clothes but fake Tote bags, saying every day that she bought limited and commemorative editions, with each small bag worth tens of thousands. She claimed she only liked collecting these limited editions of commemorative significance. Previously when we took photos for our relationship announcement, she selected two to release. One of them accidentally captured her Tote bag. She said this photo was no good because it looked like she was showing off, and asked me to pick another one without the bag to release. I later found out her Tote bags were actually fake, and she didn&rsquo;t dare release the photo in case she got recognized. There was another time she asked me to carry a crocodile skin bag that was supposedly worth over $30,000. I carried it and got my hands all blackened. I thought I had touched something dirty until I got home and realized it was only from carrying that bag. The hardware on the bag was badly discolored and I scrubbed for a long time to get it off. This made me realize her bags were all shoddy fakes, yet she was always bragging to me about how they were expensive limited editions. Her vanity and dishonesty were truly laughable.</p>
<h3 id="nail-service-abuse">Nail Service Abuse</h3>
<p>She got her nails done at a nail salon, choosing long nail stickers that were prone to falling off. The nail technician at that salon had warned her in advance that these stickers were fragile and easily detachable. But she insisted on having them, and as expected, they kept falling off frequently. Within a week, she had called the nail technician from that salon over to her home to fix her nails four times. What was even more infuriating was that each time after getting them fixed, she would haggle for lower prices. Considering the nail technician had to pay a $10-plus cab fare each time to provide service at her home, calling someone over so frequently without an ounce of apology was truly disrespectful. As a third party, I feel that even if it was free service, bothering someone four times in one week, my girlfriend would at least bring a bubble tea or something to show appreciation. This fully reveals her serious lack of respect for others, not treating those who serve her as human beings.</p>
<h3 id="failing-classes-and-giving-up">Failing Classes and Giving Up</h3>
<p>Her friend said she was going back to China, tired of life here, and told me not to pursue this matter further because I had been blocked by her. I didn&rsquo;t know if this was true or false. Later I saw her Xiaohongshu IP had changed to Guangdong. At first I thought she was using VPN or something to change it. Turns out she got friends in China to help log into her account and post works in China to switch the IP to China. Her original words to her friend were: &ldquo;I want to study well in the UK, away from complicated social circles, so I need to change my Xiaohongshu IP to the UK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aside from the relationship between social circles and IP, her so-called studying well seems to be just learning how to haggle with ghostwriters. She had 12 papers ghostwritten out of 12 courses, failed 2 courses, and got an F in 1 course. She even claimed the professor graded wrong, originally giving her 77 points but accidentally entering 37, and the professor admitted the mistake but didn&rsquo;t change the score, forcing her to retake the exam. To be honest, this excuse is even less believable than saying her papers were written by her pet cat.</p>
<p>I feel this girl&rsquo;s actions are incomprehensible. If she really wanted to learn and grow in the UK, she should complete her own schoolwork instead of relying on ghostwriters and fraud. At the same time, she should not fabricate lies to deceive others on social media. I suggest she reflect carefully, face her problems honestly, regain motivation and interest in learning, gain a sense of accomplishment and growth through her own efforts instead of relying on these improper means.</p>

<h3 id="photo-fraud">Photo Fraud</h3>
<p>I later found out that the photos she posted on Xiaohongshu were deleted right after posting, because they were all stolen pictures. The photos on her WeChat Moments were also stolen, she even directly stole other people&rsquo;s faces. But she was very smart, only stealing profile shots from a distance. Once she directly stole a mutual friend&rsquo;s photo, and when confronted about the situation, she unfriended and deleted without a word - very professional. Her own skin was dark and bumpy, yet she went to steal photos of fair-skinned beauties. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be recognized immediately? But I don&rsquo;t normally check Moments, so I didn&rsquo;t notice she was stealing photos until someone came to me with screenshots. Only then did I realize how serious it was. Simply embarrassing.</p>
<p>The following photos were all sent to me claiming to be her. I said they didn&rsquo;t look like her but she insisted it was her. If there is any offense please delete them.</p>

<h3 id="cornwall">Cornwall</h3>
<p>Regarding the Cornwall trip, someone came to me for insider news. She told others that she went with a friend, and the other was my mutual friend. But she was complaining about and vilifying me to that friend of mine every day. We are mutual friends, so why didn&rsquo;t we notice her two-faced behavior, scolding her to me and scolding me to her? It&rsquo;s like someone talking behind your back, would you go ask them why they are slandering you? I felt a little awkward and thought it&rsquo;s best to keep my distance from someone who talks bad behind backs like this. But after communicating face-to-face later, we found out it was all her making things up. My friend was also puzzled why she didn&rsquo;t take me to Cornwall. Turns out I was the &ldquo;friend&rdquo; she was referring to, not boyfriend. So she never saw me as a partner! She even said she broke up with me directly after coming back from Dubai. I wonder if she could have imagined I would hear about this from someone else? This really opened my eyes.</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-the-exs-lies">Analyzing the Ex&rsquo;s Lies</h2>
<p>Regarding the so-called &ldquo;self-proving innocence&rdquo;, I find it really laughable. She was cherry-picking and deceiving. She didn&rsquo;t even have the right attitude to begin with, yet still wanted to make a PDF accusing me. I even wondered if she had a computer. She said she only had a Mac Air, but previously posted on Xiaohongshu that she had a Mac Pro. Before coming to the UK she said she bought a 14-inch midnight purple MacBook Pro, then it became 13-inches when she arrived in the UK. She bought so many Hermes bags on Moment but none can be seen around her. When asked, she says she gave them all to friends. She always said she was unwell, fainting, it became her catchphrase. I went to ask the nurse on duty at the hospital if any Asian girl had fainted and been sent in, the nurse said no. Is this going to be explained as us going to different hospitals? Her papers were all written by ghostwriters, yet she posted on Xiaohongshu the deadline for writing her paper. The internet princess is truly hypocritical.</p>
<h3 id="overstepping-boundaries-contacting-family">Overstepping Boundaries Contacting Family</h3>
<p>She said she wanted my mom&rsquo;s WeChat to send gifts. The problem is I already said it was unnecessary, so why did she need to write down my parents&rsquo; WeChat IDs? I never took the initiative to add her parents, which doesn&rsquo;t mean she can privately contact my parents. She wanted to send voice messages to my family group using my phone. I said it was fine, my parents knew we were dating. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean she can contact my parents privately. I never supported her getting to know my family, and I don&rsquo;t like disturbing my parents with these matters. How could I have supported her contacting my family? Her words make no sense.</p>
<h3 id="online-disputes">Online Disputes</h3>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t she know how many people she has deceived and offended in the UK? She even said it was me who posted the article that ruined her reputation? When I first posted, so many people came to me for her photos and Xiaohongshu account number, but I didn&rsquo;t share them out of respect for her privacy. Then I would go dig up information about her family&rsquo;s birthdays and send them to her? I kept telling the other party not to release these things. Then I would still go search for information about her family? Too funny. She was cherry-picking the whole time. At first I didn&rsquo;t ask for money, she was the one who chased me for it, threatening my family, only then did I ask for money. But she went around saying I threatened and extorted her family for money. How could she do something so despicable? Disgusting.</p>
<h3 id="fabricating-family-background">Fabricating Family Background</h3>
<p>I never said how many billions her family had. Let me remind you, she told me her family company had a profit target in the billions, even more exaggerated than listed companies, with revenues of how much. She told others her family ran a listed real estate company. I guessed Wanke or Evergrande? She said her dad built Hainan Hai Guang Dao. I saw the construction units were two state-owned enterprises and Evergrande. She said her family ran listed real estate companies, so that would make her an heiress of Evergrande? Do you still remember her bragging to me about her family&rsquo;s three manors, the manor her uncle looked after the gate of? At the time I questioned her to let me go see it in Hainan, and she also said her family&rsquo;s dock was filled with yachts, and in Paris at Van Cleef she picked up a crown worth 100 million saying she wanted to buy it. But she never told me anything about her own family background, only bragged to me. I joked saying you&rsquo;re so rich I feel inferior, I&rsquo;ve never seen so much money before. But you took it seriously, as if you didn&rsquo;t understand sarcasm.</p>
<h3 id="denying-huge-debts">Denying Huge Debts</h3>
<p>My friend asked her if I owed 700,000? I didn&rsquo;t even know I owed so much, was this fabricated enemy? Or a fictional character? Please think, if I really owed 700,000, would the creditor care where the money went? They would only want me to repay the 700,000, they wouldn&rsquo;t be chasing her for it right? You said you earn millions a year yourself, is this your understanding of debt and money? Please don&rsquo;t mock me okay?</p>
<h3 id="dirty-earphones-dispute">Dirty Earphones Dispute</h3>
<p>Please don&rsquo;t wash those earphones again, I feel nauseous just looking at them. I could tell at a glance those were fake AirPods, filthy with grime. Everyone knows the crevices of earphones that haven&rsquo;t been cleaned for a long time accumulate dirt. The pair you gave me was already yellowed, I felt sick. And now you take a brand new pair and say the ones you originally gave me were these? Too shameless. The state of the ones you gave me was like an Iraq war veteran&rsquo;s. Now you take a completely new pair and say these were the ones you gave me. I just want to know, if they were really this new, why wouldn&rsquo;t I have wanted them?</p>
<h3 id="relationship-grudges">Relationship Grudges</h3>
<p>When did I ever dox her parents? All this information was left with me by her, I didn&rsquo;t spread it out, only told her sister I could contact her family, asked her to stop threatening my family. Then she said I threatened and tried to extort her family first and only retaliated when it didn&rsquo;t work out. Did we get our roles reversed? Wasn&rsquo;t she the one who peeked at my parents&rsquo; WeChat, wrote it down, and kept threatening my family? I couldn&rsquo;t stand her crazy behavior so I warned her not to keep harassing us right? The reason I had her family&rsquo;s information was because she asked me to help ship a package back home, needing her and the recipient&rsquo;s information that she gave me. And that became me doxing her family?</p>

<h3 id="paying-for-someone-elses-meal">Paying for someone else&rsquo;s meal</h3>
<p>There is no need to emphasize that I voluntarily bought things for her. She shamelessly said she didn&rsquo;t bring her card and asked me to pay first every time. The only things she paid for were a slice of salmon and a tiramisu, saying she wanted to make yangzhi ganlu tea for me to drink. The result was so sour it was undrinkable, she didn&rsquo;t even try it herself but made me finish it. Who can stand that? Just that one bowl of sour soup, I didn&rsquo;t dare use vinegar on my dumplings for two days afterwards. And I was the one who bought the ingredients, not only did I supply the ingredients but I had to provide the processing fee too?</p>
<h3 id="airline-ticket-fraud">Airline ticket fraud</h3>
<p>Regarding the airline ticket incident, I asked a friend to check with Air France if they had any ticket purchase records under my passport number, and Air France said no. She asked me for money, I asked her to show me a refund screenshot from Trip.com, but she only sent me a screenshot of the amount and asked for money. Plus Air France said there was no record, she didn&rsquo;t even buy a ticket and was trying to extort me? Of course it&rsquo;s also possible the domestic and international Air France systems are not synced? But given what she&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;m more inclined to believe she was committing fraud. The only regret is that she made up lies over the phone or in person, so there is incomplete evidence. But her reputation in Coventry is notorious, everyone who knows her says she is a dirty woman.</p>
