<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Last October, I met a boy who usually lives in the UK but was in China at the time to investigate the catering industry. When we first met, he told me that he liked me very much and wanted to invite me to go to the UK with him. His words scared me a bit, so I deleted his contact information afterwards.</p>
<p>However, I needed to ask him for his opinion on some things, so I added him back on WeChat in November. From then on, we contacted each other again as friends, and our chat time became more and more frequent. As we spent more time together, I slowly realized that I had fallen in love with him.</p>
<p>In mid-March of this year, he returned to China again. In early April, he came to Hangzhou to see me. By mid-April, we went to Lijiang together to meet his parents. Afterwards, he came back to Hangzhou to see me again (our relationship was like that of a couple, and his mother even took a picture of us together). He told me that he hoped I could go to the UK to find him in September.</p>
<p>However, due to work bottlenecks and discussions with him, I eventually decided to study in Italy in 2024.</p>
<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>In October 2022, the female protagonist met the male protagonist and was invited to go to the UK by him. She felt harassed and deleted him from WeChat.</p>
<p>In November 2022, the female protagonist needed the male protagonist&rsquo;s advice and re-added him on WeChat.</p>
<p>In December 2022, they started contacting each other as friends. As their conversations increased, the female protagonist found herself developing feelings for the male protagonist.</p>
<p>In March 2023, the male protagonist returned to China, and the female protagonist&rsquo;s feelings gradually deepened.</p>
<p>In early April 2023, the male protagonist came to Hangzhou to see the female protagonist.</p>
<p>In mid-April 2023, they met with the male protagonist&rsquo;s parents in Lijiang, and the male protagonist came to Hangzhou to see the female protagonist again. The male protagonist&rsquo;s mother took a group photo of them. The female protagonist decided to study abroad in Italy in 2024.</p>
<p>On April 14, 2023, the female protagonist returned to Hangzhou, and the male protagonist returned to Jinan.</p>
<p>On April 17, 2023, the male protagonist&rsquo;s British girlfriend flew back to Jinan from the UK and celebrated her birthday at the male protagonist&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>On April 19, 2023, the male protagonist came to Hangzhou to see the female protagonist again.</p>
<p>On April 21, 2023, the male protagonist went to Bangkok to transfer to the UK and stayed in Bangkok for 10 days. During this time, the male protagonist&rsquo;s British girlfriend was also in Bangkok.</p>
<p>In May 2023, after a night of arguing, the male protagonist told the female protagonist in the early morning that he had a girlfriend in the UK. Later, the male protagonist&rsquo;s British girlfriend called the female protagonist and revealed the male protagonist&rsquo;s bad behavior and their relationship. The female protagonist learned that she was not the only girlfriend of the male protagonist, but a victim of a series of deceitful behaviors.</p>
<h2 id="charge">Charge</h2>
<p>Last night we argued for a long time, but eventually made up. In the early hours of the morning, he called me and told me that he had a girlfriend in the UK who had previously deceived him and was causing trouble (he had mentioned a previous girlfriend in our chats). He then asked me to look at their chat history and told me to buy a plane ticket to fly to the UK to be with him. I naively believed him.</p>
<p>When I woke up, it was already afternoon and I had already missed an Italian class. He called me again, but this time, to my surprise, it was a girl who spoke to me (and he was shouting in the background to give him back his phone). It was obvious that he was deceiving me and then having his girlfriend handle it (because they had a vested interest and there was no possibility of separation). This girl showed me some evidence of his bad behavior and infidelity during their two years together.</p>
<p>She also told me that I was not the first, and there were many people before me. This girl added me on WeChat, and I saw a very absurd operation: check-in on April 8th, we went to Lijiang with his parents on April 14th, and I returned to Hangzhou on April 14th. He returned to Jinan, and his girlfriend flew back to Jinan from the UK on April 17th and spent her birthday at his home. On April 19th, he came to Hangzhou to see me, and on the morning of April 21st, he flew from Bangkok to the UK (staying in Bangkok for 10 days), and that girl was also in Bangkok. During this period, they never stopped chatting with me until I found out the truth yesterday morning&hellip; During the process of that girl adding me on WeChat and talking to me, he kept sending me WeChat messages telling me that he liked me and wanted to marry me&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding what you most want to know, why did I add him and some things I wanted to ask at the time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We talked about career issues the first time we met. He said he wanted to open a Japanese restaurant in the UK, and I had previously opened one in Hangzhou. Later, he talked about a topic related to the tourism industry, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to have any intention of getting involved in that field himself. After that, we didn&rsquo;t talk about these topics again.</p>
<p>In November, my career hit a bottleneck, and I suddenly remembered these topics, so I added him back to my friend list. But when we chatted later, he didn&rsquo;t mention anything about wanting to get involved in these areas, so we didn&rsquo;t talk about these topics again.</p>
<p>In December, China had just announced its opening up, and I went to Thailand for a vacation. I used to have an assistant arrange my itinerary when I went to Thailand, but that time I went with two travel idiots who didn&rsquo;t know how to plan. Because he had spent a long holiday in Thailand before, I asked him for advice. After that, we started chatting every day. As an Aries, I have a straightforward personality and speak my mind, so I got along well with him.</p>
<p>When we were together, he didn&rsquo;t spend any money on me or give me any gifts, but he should have covered the regular expenses such as hotel, food, and transportation. I am indeed a love brain, and the time from meeting my exes to being together did not exceed one month, but not all Aries women will tie themselves to one tree.</p>
<p>For those who act cute and try to be keyboard warriors, please save your energy and stop bothering me.</p>
