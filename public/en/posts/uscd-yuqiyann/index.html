<h2 id="accusation">Accusation</h2>
<p>Expose a drug-addicted female international student named Yan Yuqi (WeChat: 可爱小桃花/ins: Yuqiyannn) who ran away to Shanghai.</p>
<p>She put her own son in a urine pool filled with gas cylinders and lost control after taking drugs, and went out to eat sea urchins while leaving the child alone at home to starve to death. The police have determined this as a &ldquo;possible criminal offense&rdquo; and are investigating the specific cause of the child&rsquo;s death.</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-1.avif" data-thumbnail="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-1.avif" data-sub-html="<h2>Yan Yuqi and gas cylinders</h2>"><img loading="lazy" src="fig-1.avif" srcset="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-1.avif, fig-1.avif 1.5x, /en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-1.avif 2x" sizes="auto" data-title="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-1.avif" data-alt="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-1.avif" width="480px" style="background: url(/svg/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}"/></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Yan Yuqi and gas cylinders</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>During this process, Ms. Yan was anxious and uneasy, and dared not continue to live in her rented apartment. She wanted to use someone else&rsquo;s identity to book a hotel room. Even when she went to a restaurant to eat, she thought that the police were coming to arrest her when she saw them outside, so she kept trembling outside and dared not go inside.</p>
<p>Moreover, when she was preparing to flee back to China, she heard her name being called over the airport broadcast and thought that the police were monitoring her and trying to arrest her, so she was scared and stayed in the airport toilet for two hours.</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-3.avif" data-thumbnail="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-3.avif" data-sub-html="<h2>Gas cylinders scattered in the bathroom</h2>"><img loading="lazy" src="fig-3.avif" srcset="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-3.avif, fig-3.avif 1.5x, /en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-3.avif 2x" sizes="auto" data-title="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-3.avif" data-alt="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-3.avif" width="480px" style="background: url(/svg/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}"/></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Gas cylinders scattered in the bathroom</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>Now that she is at a dead end, Ms. Yan frantically contacted her ex-boyfriend C and begged him not to let her spend the rest of her life in prison on the condition that she gave birth to a child for him. Ms. Yan did not even attend her own son&rsquo;s funeral. After fleeing back to China, she began to extort money from her ex-boyfriend C, demanding that he help her deal with the troubles she left in the United States and pay all related expenses, including fines and debts for her apartment ($5-6K), moving and cleaning costs (nearly $900, due to thousands of gas cylinders on the ground), and even her medical expenses after returning to China.</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-2.avif" data-thumbnail="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-2.avif" data-sub-html="<h2>Gas cylinders scattered in the living room</h2>"><img loading="lazy" src="fig-2.avif" srcset="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-2.avif, fig-2.avif 1.5x, /en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-2.avif 2x" sizes="auto" data-title="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-2.avif" data-alt="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-2.avif" width="480px" style="background: url(/svg/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}"/></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Gas cylinders scattered in the living room</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>According to the exposure, Ms. Yan once shoplifted in a department store and received a lawsuit letter from the store. When C found out about this, he decided to break up with her. Ms. Yan swore to change her ways and begged for C&rsquo;s forgiveness and a chance to reconcile. However, outside, she constantly slandered and defamed C, creating a false image of herself as a victim of C&rsquo;s mistreatment.</p>
<p>During their cohabitation, C bore all the daily expenses and rent, while Ms. Yan turned things around and fantasized about claiming that she was the one supporting C.</p>
<p>She even threatened C, saying that if he didn&rsquo;t pay her, she would slander and distort the truth.</p>
<p>After the final breakup in June 2022, C and Ms. Yan&rsquo;s relationship had completely broken down. Several months later, Ms. Yan told C that she was already seven or eight months pregnant and had no source of income or ability to take care of herself during the pregnancy. C took Ms. Yan to the hospital for a check-up, confirming the pregnancy. Due to Ms. Yan&rsquo;s situation, C agreed to temporarily move back in to take care of her until the child was safely born. However, because their relationship had already broken down, they could not provide a happy home for the child. Ms. Yan and C agreed that C would be responsible for choosing a happy foster home for the child and that Ms. Yan would not breastfeed the child.</p>

<p>After the child was born, he was adopted and taken care of by a LA Asian couple. However, Ms. Yan suddenly changed her mind and wanted the child back, using this as a way to force C to reconcile with her. Ms. Yan promised C that she would never again engage in illegal activities such as drug use, prostitution, and theft. However, when the child returned, Ms. Yan was still immersed in her drug-induced fantasies, failing to feed or change the child on time, even leaving the child in urine after getting high on drugs, in a room filled with gas cylinders.</p>
<p>When C came home from work and saw all this, he was furious. However, he still insisted on bathing the child, changing his diaper, and feeding him to ensure the child&rsquo;s health and safety.</p>

<p>Ms. Yan had an emotional outburst and even picked up a kitchen knife and threatened C&rsquo;s personal safety, which forced C to leave his own home. Since C and Ms. Yan were not married, Ms. Yan had sole custody of their child, and C could not take the child away without permission to raise him alone.</p>
<p>C wanted to check on the child&rsquo;s safety, but Ms. Yan locked the door and even refused to let C see the child. During this time, Ms. Yan did not take care of the child, causing the child to become emaciated, with sunken eye sockets, blue skin, and bony limbs, and ultimately starved to death.</p>
<p>On the night before the child&rsquo;s death, Ms. Yan even went to a Michelin-starred restaurant for a date, and even sent pictures of sea urchins to taunt C. When C asked about the child&rsquo;s health, Ms. Yan ignored the question and only emphasized her emotional needs.</p>
<p>Ms. Yan only wanted to reunite with C through their child, falsely claiming that she would no longer use drugs, but did not want to take care of the child. She showed no mercy, respect, or appreciation for the fresh life that had just come into this world, and only wanted to extort money from C through the child to cover up her heinous behavior.</p>

<p>During this period, C was concerned about the safety of the child and visited Yan&rsquo;s home several times during the day, but Yan locked the door. On the evening of April 2nd, C learned that Yan was going to go to a Michelin restaurant to eat sea urchins. Because of concerns for the child&rsquo;s safety, C returned to Yan&rsquo;s home during the lunch break on April 3rd to check on the child&rsquo;s condition. C heard the child crying at the door and wanted to go in to check, but the door was locked by Yan. C had to ask Yan about the child&rsquo;s condition through text messages and asked if the child was healthy and safe. If there were any problems, they should go to the hospital immediately. Yan did not answer directly, and did not mention the child in the subsequent conversation, only repeatedly emphasizing her own needs.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of April 4th, Ms. Yan saw that her child&rsquo;s body had turned color before telling C that the child&rsquo;s health was in danger, and sent a photo of the child. The child was already emaciated, with sunken eye sockets and a bluish complexion. When C saw the photo of the child, he was shocked and immediately rushed to the scene to take the child to the hospital for rescue. However, Ms. Yan was calm and even wanted to force a bottle into the mouth of the child who had already stopped breathing to cover up the fact that she had not fed the child.</p>
<p>At the hospital, the doctor informed C that although the child had a body temperature, he had already passed away. The police began to investigate the cause of the child&rsquo;s death and examined the phones of C and Ms. Yan for evidence. It was discovered that Ms. Yan had threatened C with a knife in their conversation and informed C that the child&rsquo;s death was a &ldquo;possible criminal act&rdquo;. Ms. Yan continued to threaten C&rsquo;s personal safety and could provide the case number as evidence to assist C in obtaining a restraining order against Ms. Yan to ensure C&rsquo;s personal safety in the future.</p>

<h4 id="statement-from-yan-yuqi">Statement from Yan Yuqi</h4>
<p>I would like to respond to my situation:</p>
<p>First of all, I have never had a record of a chaotic private life. My hospital records prove that I have always been resistant to unprotected sex and I even promised to take responsibility if I became pregnant.</p>
<p>Secondly, the paternity test result is 99.99% certain that he is the father of the child, but when he went to the hospital, he claimed that he had no medical insurance and could not afford to raise the child with his income of 2,000 yuan, so he requested that the child be fostered. The doctor can testify to this.</p>
<p>Thirdly, out of mutual respect, I did not reveal the child&rsquo;s surname to any relatives or friends. I have repeatedly stated that I am a new mother and I can afford it financially, but I also hope that he will take responsibility as a father. However, he said that the child and I were dragging him down, and even asked me to seek a psychologist to cope with it. Call records can prove this.</p>
<p>Fourthly, he believed that my lifestyle would affect the child&rsquo;s health, but during the hospitalization, I underwent a comprehensive screening and consulted with doctors. After the child was born, a comprehensive examination was also conducted, and there were no problems. Medical records can prove this.</p>
<p>Fifthly, two days before the child&rsquo;s death, I had already informed him that the child and I were both sick. He believed that I was the natural guardian of the child, so everything he did was extra help. In fact, he and I shared half of the guardianship responsibility, but he was unwilling to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Sixth, he did not pay me any compensation for the pregnancy, and after my child and I passed away, he used the child to justify his actions and avoid taking responsibility. He knew my whereabouts but did not sympathize with my pain of losing a child. Instead, he saw it as an opportunity to avoid being reported and mistreated me while slandering me.</p>
<p>Essentially, he is an irresponsible, finger-pointing, selfish, petty, photo-editing, and STD-infected person. Despite his irresponsibility, he still pretends to be perfect and even applies for a restraining order, which is truly ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="details-content">
      <div class="admonition-content"><p>The branded girlfriend bought him a Ferrari, which he paid for with a loan. He had to pay 2,000 RMB per month for the car loan and had no medical insurance. During the pregnancy, the girlfriend suggested doing a DNA test, but the man ignored the safety of the pregnant woman during the eight months of pregnancy. After the child was born, the man said that he could not afford to raise the child and wanted to give the child to someone else, but the woman did not agree. So, the man left the child with the single girlfriend and disappeared, only offering to compensate her with 40,000 RMB.</p>
<p>During the postpartum period, the girlfriend was weak and sick, and the child&rsquo;s condition was also very serious, eventually leading to death. The man had been drinking outside all the time, claiming to be doing business, but he had always owed financial support and had never taken care of the girlfriend and the child. Afterwards, the man said that the girlfriend had killed his child by neglecting to take care of it. The girlfriend, for personal safety and emotional reasons, decided to leave the country and return home.</p>
<p>In order to continue pretending to be rich and to find more girls to pay for him, the man distorted the truth and even accused the girlfriend of being on the run. He promised to help the girlfriend handle things, but in reality, he only dealt with the things that were jointly owned, and he did not even send back the girlfriend&rsquo;s personal belongings. The man also lied that the girlfriend had already fled back to her country, and even concealed her positive Covid test result, claiming that she had an STD.</p>

<p>Firstly, C never sought public accounts or purchased water army hype, and Ms. Yan immediately extorted C after returning to China, which C did not agree to. After that, Ms. Yan harassed C&rsquo;s friends through various channels and published a defamatory article about C. In fact, &ldquo;exposure article&rdquo; was first published by Ms. Yan, but all the content in the article was fabricated and had no evidence. Later, C had to refute and clarify this so-called &ldquo;exposure article&rdquo; to reveal the truth to everyone. The reason why this article was widely spread on the Internet was that Ms. Yan&rsquo;s actions were too extreme, which had seriously challenged people&rsquo;s values.</p>
<p>Secondly, Ms. Yan claimed that C had put the child in foster care without permission and slandered C by saying &ldquo;the child and Ms. Yan dragged C to get rich&rdquo;. In fact, this was completely made up by Ms. Yan. After the child was born, Ms. Yan clearly stated that she would not breastfeed the child. Before the child was born, the two parties had already agreed to find a responsible adoptive family for the child to have a better future, which was a consensus between the two parties, not just C&rsquo;s idea. Regarding the choice of adoptive family, Ms. Yan never participated. C found an Asian couple living in Los Angeles who took great care of the child and were very concerned about the child. When they saw the child for the first time, they cried and even built a playground in their backyard. After the child was adopted, Ms. Yan, who had sole custody, took the child back without consulting with C (according to local laws in the United States, the child&rsquo;s mother has the right to take back the child within a specified period of time). During this period, Ms. Yan repeatedly promised and swore to C that she would quit drugs, take good care of the child, and even raised the reason to &ldquo;not deprive her of her rights as a mother&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Since C and Ms. Yan are not in a marital relationship and have not established any marriage relationship, the custody of the child belongs only to the child&rsquo;s mother. After being threatened with a knife by Ms. Yan, C attempted to seek help from lawyers and social workers to fight for custody of the child, but was told that these legal actions would take time to complete.</p>

<p>One day, when C returned to Yan&rsquo;s residence after work, he saw a shocking scene. Yan had taken drugs and lost control of her bladder, leaving the child lying in urine, next to used gas cylinders (as shown in the figure below). However, in the so-called &ldquo;shocking reversal&rdquo; article, Yan lied and claimed that she had never used drugs after the child was born.</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-9.avif" data-thumbnail="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-9.avif" data-sub-html="<h2>Charles covered in urine</h2>"><img loading="lazy" src="fig-9.avif" srcset="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-9.avif, fig-9.avif 1.5x, /en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-9.avif 2x" sizes="auto" data-title="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-9.avif" data-alt="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-9.avif" width="480px" style="background: url(/svg/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}"/></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Charles covered in urine</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>C was furious and trembling when he saw this scene. However, he still insisted on bathing the child, changing the diaper, and feeding the baby. Here, I want to ask Yan a question: Can you honestly swear that you have the basic ability to take care of and feed your own child like a normal and qualified mother?</p>
<p>C&rsquo;s biggest regret was not reporting to the police at that time. Because he believed that Yan still had some humanity and would not completely abandon her own flesh and blood. He did not expect that Yan would starve her own child to death the day after eating Michelin (sea urchin).</p>

<p>After seeing this scene, C was so angry that he was shaking. Nevertheless, he persisted in washing the child, changing diapers, and feeding him. Here, I would like to ask Ms. Yan a question: do you have the basic ability of a normal and qualified mother to take care of and feed your own child?</p>
<p>C&rsquo;s biggest regret is that he did not report to the police at that time. He thought that Ms. Yan still had some humanity and would not let her own flesh and blood perish. What he didn&rsquo;t expect was that Ms. Yan would starve her own child to death the day after eating at Michelin (sea urchin).</p>

<p>C never asked Ms. Yan for money, only asked her to pay the fine she incurred in the apartment, totaling $5,211.20. This includes the cost of replacing the carpet and floor in the apartment, due to Ms. Yan&rsquo;s incontinence.</p>
<p>Ms. Yan claimed that C&rsquo;s statement that she was supporting him was purely her own fantasy and welcomed her to provide evidence to prove otherwise. Ms. Yan has been having hallucinations since she started using drugs, and even sent messages to C&rsquo;s friends claiming &ldquo;my father is the mayor&rdquo; when she was in a delusional state. The following image is evidence of Ms. Yan harassing one of C&rsquo;s friends.</p>

  </figure>
<p>During her relationship with C, Ms. Yan had flirtatious conversations with various men.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Ms. Yan not handling her child&rsquo;s funeral, C had visited the hospital multiple times to inquire about the child&rsquo;s autopsy and funeral arrangements, but was told that he did not have the authority. The hospital informed C that the necessary samples for the autopsy had been collected, but there were only two forensic doctors in the entire county, and there were many cases waiting for autopsy, so they had to wait. Since Ms. Yan had custody of the child, her signature was required for the child&rsquo;s funeral, but Ms. Yan had fled back to China.</p>
<p>In order to bury the child as soon as possible, C is in discussions with the hospital about whether they can bypass Ms. Yan for the funeral. This is a local policy and legal requirement, which can be verified by legal or hospital professionals.</p>
<p>Here, we request that Ms. Yan take responsibility for her actions and at least allow the child to be buried as soon as possible. If Ms. Yan is really innocent as she claims, we urge her to return to the United States to attend the child&rsquo;s funeral and wait for the results of the police investigation. This will make the truth clearer and also give her a &ldquo;clean slate.&rdquo;</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-16.avif" data-thumbnail="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-16.avif" data-sub-html="<h2>Abandoned armor and weapons</h2>"><img loading="lazy" src="fig-16.avif" srcset="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-16.avif, fig-16.avif 1.5x, /en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-16.avif 2x" sizes="auto" data-title="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-16.avif" data-alt="/en/posts/uscd-yuqiyann/fig-16.avif" width="480px" style="background: url(/svg/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;this.alt=this.dataset.alt;for(const a of ['style','data-title','data-alt','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(a);}"/></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Abandoned armor and weapons</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>The sixth point is about the so-called &ldquo;pregnancy compensation&rdquo; issue. Ms. Yan did not fulfill her responsibilities as a mother and let her own flesh and blood starve to death. And on the night before the child&rsquo;s death, she was still eating Michelin-starred sea urchins. C already hates Ms. Yan to the bone, and Ms. Yan still dares to demand &ldquo;pregnancy compensation&rdquo;? Then who should compensate for the deceased child?</p>
<p>Until the formal investigation results are released, Ms. Yan&rsquo;s entry and exit cannot be easily restricted, which is a principle followed by all countries&rsquo; laws. If Ms. Yan has done nothing wrong, why was she so nervous when she saw the police in public? If losing a child is so painful, why didn&rsquo;t she bury the child in a timely manner, attend the funeral, and take even her luggage before fleeing back to China?</p>

<p>Point 8: Regarding false accusations such as STB and WEEE, Ms. Yan is requested to stop spreading false statements and provide substantive evidence.

<p>Finally, if Ms. Yan is truly as innocent and concerned about her child as she claims, she should return to the United States to bid farewell to her child and wait for the police to investigate the case and find the truth for her child.</p>
